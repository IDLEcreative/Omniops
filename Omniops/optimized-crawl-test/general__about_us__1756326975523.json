Thompsons eParts is part of the Thompsons UK Group of companies, With Eleven factories in Blackburn, Croydon, Dover and Edinburgh, Thompsons provides a truly national coverage – not just for sales of new truck bodies but also for after-sales parts and service support too.\nAs well as having parts available over the counter, Thompsons eParts also offers tipper operators the unique opportunity to order parts over the internet.\nBy simply visiting www.thompsonseparts.co.uk, you can purchase anything from a set of replacement hydraulic seals to a whole sheeting system to general CV accessories like wheel nut indicators\nOur eParts site currently offers some 5,000 individual parts lines, not just for our own bodies but also for leading OEMs such as Edbro, Hyva, Binotto, HARSH and Palfinger. Then there’s a whole catalogue of other ancillary items too.\nThompsons eParts is a true ‘first’ for the tipping industry. These are parts that you can get now – when you need them.\n\nThompsons is the clear UK market leader in tipper truck bodybuilding.\n\nWhy? Because no other company offers the product range that Thompsons offers, and no other company can match either our physical resources or continuous levels of investment.\nThese strengths are vitally important to customers, who are often spending large sums of money on fleet replacement programmes. They choose Thompsons partly because we offer long-term reassurance, but equally because our products outperform the rest.\nBut our success is not just about products. It’s also about service, about response, and a real commitment to after sales support. In short, it’s about us as people, how we work and where we want to go. For these reasons and more, customers choose to put their trust in Thompsons.\n\nA proven track record is one thing. Another is being fully set for the future.\n\nThe dedicated Parts and Service facility based in Blackburn is the physical expression of Thompsons commitment to make available the largest possible range of parts and aftermarket items to the industry . The aim: to build even further on Thompsons ability to give Tipper operators the speediest and most comprehensive back-up in the industry.\n\nShop by department\nThompsons Tipper Truck Body Parts\nCrane Parts\nTipping Gear & Brackets\nPalfinger Parts\nTipper & Trailer Sheeting Systems & Spares\nLighting\nGrab Buckets & Brick Grabs\nTruck Tool Boxes & Storage\nSkip & Hookloader Parts\nHydraulic Oil Tanks\nHere to help\nGot questions?\n01254 914 750\nT: 01254 914750\nT: 01254 914800\nThompsons eParts Ltd\nSite 5, Veritas House, Sett End Road North\nShadsworth Business Park,\nBlackburn,\nLancashire,\nBB1 2PT\nSecure Shopping\nPrivacy Policy\n(GDPR) General Data Protection Regulations Policy 2018\nCookie Policy\nTerms & Conditions\nDelivery Policy\nReturns & Refunds\nCookie Policy (UK)\nManage Consent\nTo provide the best experiences, we use technologies like cookies to store and/",
