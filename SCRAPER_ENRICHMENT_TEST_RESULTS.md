## Key Integration Points Verified

### 1. ContentEnricher Import (Lines 1167-1169)
✅ Module properly imported in scraper-worker.js
```javascript
const { ContentEnricher } = require('./content-enricher');
```

### 2. Enrichment Process (Lines 1171-1182)
✅ Chunks are enriched before embedding generation
```javascript
const enrichedChunks = chunks.map(chunk => {
  if (ContentEnricher.needsEnrichment(chunk)) {
    return ContentEnricher.enrichContent(
      chunk,
      dbRecord.metadata,
      pageUrl,
      pageData.title || ''
    );
  }
  return chunk;
});
```

### 3. Quality Scoring (Lines 1184-1192)
✅ Enrichment quality is calculated and logged
```javascript
const quality = ContentEnricher.calculateEnrichmentQuality(enrichedChunks[0]);
console.log(`Content enrichment score: ${quality.enrichmentScore}/100`);
```

### 4. Enriched Embeddings (Line 1194)
✅ Enriched chunks are passed to embedding generation
```javascript
const embeddings = await generateEmbeddings(enrichedChunks);
```
