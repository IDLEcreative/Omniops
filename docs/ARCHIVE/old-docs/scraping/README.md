# Archived Scraping Documentation

**Archive Date:** October 24, 2025

## Purpose

This directory contains legacy scraping documentation files that have been consolidated into a single comprehensive guide.

## New Location

All scraping documentation is now available at:
**[docs/02-FEATURES/scraping/README.md](../../../02-FEATURES/scraping/README.md)**

## Archived Files

The following files were consolidated and archived:

1. **SCRAPING_ARCHITECTURE.md** - System architecture overview with diagrams
2. **SCRAPER-ARCHITECTURE.md** - Multi-layer scraper component details
3. **SCRAPING_SYSTEM.md** - Web scraping system overview
4. **SCRAPING_SYSTEM_COMPLETE.md** - Complete system documentation with fixes
5. **SCRAPING_IMPROVEMENTS.md** - Redis-based improvements and optimizations
6. **WEB_SCRAPING.md** - General web scraping guide
7. **SCRAPING_API.md** - API reference and examples
8. **SCRAPER_CONFIGURATION.md** - Configuration system documentation
9. **SCRAPING_OPERATIONS.md** - Operational runbook and procedures
10. **SCRAPING_AND_EMBEDDING_SYSTEM.md** - Thompson's eParts case study with metadata

## What Was Consolidated

The new comprehensive guide includes all information from these documents, organized into:

### Core Sections
- **Overview** - System capabilities and use cases
- **Architecture** - Component diagrams and data flow
- **Key Features** - Intelligent scraping, extraction, optimization
- **Getting Started** - Installation, setup, quick start
- **API Reference** - Complete API with examples in multiple languages
- **Configuration** - Presets, environment variables, runtime config
- **Content Extraction** - Multi-strategy extraction pipeline
- **Embedding Generation** - Chunking, batching, search strategies
- **Performance Optimization** - Speed, cost, reliability tuning
- **Monitoring & Debugging** - Health checks, metrics, real-time monitoring
- **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
- **Best Practices** - Pre-scraping, during, and post-scraping guidelines
- **Maintenance** - Daily, weekly, monthly procedures
- **Advanced Topics** - Force rescrape, custom rules, webhooks
- **Production Deployment** - Vercel, Docker, scaling considerations

## Benefits of Consolidation

1. **Single Source of Truth** - One comprehensive document instead of 10+
2. **No Duplication** - Eliminated redundant information across files
3. **Better Organization** - Logical flow from basics to advanced topics
4. **Complete Coverage** - All technical details preserved and enhanced
5. **Easy Navigation** - Table of contents with anchor links
6. **Consistent Formatting** - Unified style and structure
7. **Up-to-Date** - Reflects current v2.0 implementation

## Document Statistics

- **New Document:** 1,543 lines
- **Sections:** 13 major sections
- **Code Examples:** 50+ practical examples
- **Tables:** 10+ reference tables
- **Topics Covered:** Architecture, API, Configuration, Extraction, Embeddings, Performance, Monitoring, Troubleshooting, Maintenance, Deployment

## If You Need the Old Files

These files are preserved here for reference but should not be updated. All future updates should go to:
**[docs/02-FEATURES/scraping/README.md](../../../02-FEATURES/scraping/README.md)**

Redirect files have been created at the original locations pointing to the new documentation.
