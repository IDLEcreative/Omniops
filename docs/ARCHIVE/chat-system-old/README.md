This directory contains archived chat system documentation that has been consolidated into the new unified documentation structure.

1. **CHAT_IMPROVEMENTS_ROADMAP.md**
   - Roadmap for chat improvements
   - Historical planning document
   - Archived as reference for completed features

## New Documentation Location

All current chat system documentation is now located at:

**Primary Location**: `docs/02-FEATURES/chat-system/`

### Structure:
- `README.md` - Complete chat system guide
- `hallucination-prevention.md` - Anti-hallucination measures

### Related Documentation:
- `docs/CHAT_ROUTES_COMPARISON.md` - Route comparison (kept current)
- `docs/SEARCH_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Search internals (kept current)

- `docs/implementation/CHAT_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md` - Recent improvements (kept current)

## Redirect Files

The following files have been converted to redirect files pointing to new documentation:
- `docs/CHAT_SYSTEM_DOCS.md`
- `docs/CHAT_SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- `docs/INTELLIGENT_CHAT_MIGRATION.md`
- `docs/HALLUCINATION_PREVENTION.md`

## Reason for Consolidation

The chat system had 7+ documentation files with:
- Duplicate information across multiple files
- Outdated implementation details
- Unclear current vs historical status
- No single source of truth

The consolidation provides:
- Single authoritative source
- Clear separation between current implementation and roadmap
- Improved organization and navigation
- Reduced maintenance burden
- Better discoverability for developers
