## Verification Commands

### Check redirect files exist:
```bash
ls -la docs/*DEPLOYMENT*.md docs/*CHECKLIST*.md | grep -v ARCHIVE
```

### Verify redirect content:
```bash
for file in docs/DEPLOYMENT*.md docs/PRODUCTION*.md docs/SMART_PERIODIC*.md; do
  if [ -f "$file" ]; then
    echo "=== $file ==="
    head -5 "$file"
    echo ""
  fi
done
```

### Count lines in consolidated guide:
```bash
wc -l docs/05-DEPLOYMENT/production-checklist.md
```

### Verify all sections present:
```bash
grep "^## " docs/05-DEPLOYMENT/production-checklist.md
```
