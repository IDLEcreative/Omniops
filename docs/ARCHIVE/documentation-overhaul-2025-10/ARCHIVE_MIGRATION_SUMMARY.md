## Git History Preservation

All files were moved using `git mv` to preserve complete history:

```bash

grep -r "keyword" docs/ARCHIVE/
```

- Test infrastructure improvements
- Integration test fixes

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Root Directory**
   - 93% reduction in root markdown files
   - Easy to find active documentation
   - Professional project structure

2. **Better Organization**
   - Categorized by type (forensics vs. analysis)
   - Indexed for easy navigation
   - Related reports grouped together

3. **Preserved History**
   - Full git history maintained
   - Easy to trace development decisions
   - Searchable archive

4. **Improved Navigation**

   - Logical directory structure

## Access Instructions

### View Archived Reports
```bash
# List all forensic reports
ls docs/ARCHIVE/forensics/

# List all analysis reports
ls docs/ARCHIVE/analysis/

# Read an index
cat docs/ARCHIVE/forensics/INDEX.md
```

### Search Archives
```bash
# Find references to a topic
grep -r "WooCommerce" docs/ARCHIVE/

# Find files by name pattern
find docs/ARCHIVE -name "*PERFORMANCE*"
```

### View File History
```bash
# See commits for an archived file
git log --follow docs/ARCHIVE/analysis/FILENAME.md

# See what changed in a specific commit
git show <commit-hash>
```

## Verification

- Root directory: ✓ 9 primary docs remain
- Forensics archive: ✓ 11 reports + INDEX.md
- Analysis archive: ✓ 118 reports + INDEX.md
- Git history: ✓ All moves tracked with `git mv`
- Total files moved: ✓ 129

## Next Steps

1. Review root directory to ensure all remaining files are appropriate
2. Update any internal links that referenced moved files
3. Consider creating a `.github/ARCHIVE_POLICY.md` for future reference
4. Update contributor guidelines to reference archive structure
