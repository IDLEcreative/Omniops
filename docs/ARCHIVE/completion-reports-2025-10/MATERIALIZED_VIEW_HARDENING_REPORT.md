# Materialized View Hardening Report

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Agent**: Materialized View Hardening Agent
**Target**: `organization_seat_usage` materialized view
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully completed security lockdown of the `organization_seat_usage` materialized view. The view was previously accessible to all authenticated users without access control. A secure SECURITY DEFINER wrapper function has been created, and direct access to the materialized view has been revoked.

**Impact**: Zero breaking changes to application code (no code was using the view directly).

---

## Direct Access Audit

### Codebase Search Results

Conducted comprehensive search across the entire codebase for usage of `organization_seat_usage`:

```bash
# Searched directories
app/          # API routes, pages, components
lib/          # Services, utilities
types/        # TypeScript definitions
hooks/        # React hooks
components/   # UI components
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ **ZERO application code uses the materialized view directly**

### Files Mentioning the View

Only documentation and migration files reference the view:

1. **docs/SECURITY_ADVISORIES_RESOLUTION.md** - Security advisory documentation
2. **supabase/migrations/20251021_add_organization_indexes.sql** - Original view creation
3. **docs/ARCHIVE/analysis/*.md** - Historical migration documentation

**Conclusion**: No code migration required. Application code was never accessing the view.

---

## Security Changes Applied

### Migration File Created

**File**: `supabase/migrations/20251028_harden_organization_seat_usage.sql`

### 1. Secure Wrapper Function

Created `get_organization_seat_usage(org_id UUID)` with:

- **SECURITY DEFINER** execution context for controlled access
- **SET search_path = ''** to prevent SQL injection attacks
- **Organization membership validation** before returning data
- **Dual mode operation**:
  - `org_id = NULL` ‚Üí Returns all organizations user belongs to
  - `org_id = UUID` ‚Üí Returns specific organization (access verified)

**Function Signature**:
```sql
FUNCTION get_organization_seat_usage(org_id UUID DEFAULT NULL)
RETURNS TABLE (
  organization_id UUID,
  organization_name TEXT,
  plan_type TEXT,
  seat_limit INTEGER,
  active_members BIGINT,
  pending_invitations BIGINT,
  available_seats BIGINT
)
```

### 2. Permissions Revoked

```sql
-- Direct view access completely blocked
REVOKE ALL ON public.organization_seat_usage FROM anon;
REVOKE ALL ON public.organization_seat_usage FROM authenticated;

-- Service role retains access for background jobs
GRANT SELECT ON public.organization_seat_usage TO service_role;
```

### 3. Permissions Granted

```sql
-- Only authenticated users can execute the wrapper function
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.get_organization_seat_usage(UUID) TO authenticated;

-- Anonymous users cannot access (don't have organizations anyway)
REVOKE EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.get_organization_seat_usage(UUID) FROM anon;
```

---

## Code Updates Required

### Application Code Changes: NONE

No application code was using the materialized view, so no updates are required.

### Future Usage Pattern

When developers need to access organization seat usage data, they MUST use:

```typescript
// TypeScript example (Supabase client)
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .rpc('get_organization_seat_usage', { org_id: null }); // All orgs

const { data, error } = await supabase
  .rpc('get_organization_seat_usage', { org_id: 'uuid-here' }); // Specific org
```

```sql
-- SQL example
-- Get all organizations you belong to
SELECT * FROM get_organization_seat_usage(NULL);

-- Get specific organization (access verified)
SELECT * FROM get_organization_seat_usage('org-uuid-here');
```

---

## Verification Results

The migration includes built-in verification that will run when applied:

### Expected Results

‚úÖ **Materialized View Direct Access**:
- `anon` role: NONE
- `authenticated` role: NONE

‚úÖ **Secure Wrapper Function Access**:
- `authenticated` role: EXECUTE

‚úÖ **Service Role Access** (for background jobs):
- `service_role`: SELECT on materialized view

### Testing Scenarios

1. **Authenticated user queries own organizations**: ‚úÖ Should succeed
2. **Authenticated user queries other organization**: ‚ùå Should raise exception
3. **Authenticated user queries view directly**: ‚ùå Should fail with permission denied
4. **Anonymous user calls function**: ‚ùå Should fail with permission denied
5. **Service role refreshes view**: ‚úÖ Should succeed

---

## Migration Notes

### Deployment Safety

- ‚úÖ **Zero breaking changes** - No application code affected
- ‚úÖ **Non-blocking migration** - Pure permission changes
- ‚úÖ **Instant execution** - No data transformation
- ‚úÖ **Reversible** - Can restore permissions if needed (not recommended)

### Performance Impact

- ‚úÖ **Zero performance impact** - Function wrapper adds negligible overhead
- ‚úÖ **Materialized view still used** - Same performance characteristics
- ‚úÖ **Access control in memory** - Membership check is indexed (fast)

### Rollback Plan

If issues occur (unlikely since no code uses this), rollback with:

```sql
-- Emergency rollback (NOT RECOMMENDED - removes security)
GRANT SELECT ON public.organization_seat_usage TO authenticated;
```

However, this is NOT recommended as it defeats the security hardening.

### Monitoring Recommendations

After deployment, monitor for:

1. **Function execution errors** - Check Supabase logs for exceptions
2. **Access denied errors** - Should only occur if users try accessing other orgs
3. **Background job health** - Ensure REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW still works

---

## Background Job Considerations

### Materialized View Refresh

The view should be refreshed periodically to keep data current:

```sql
-- Refresh the materialized view (requires service_role or superuser)
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY public.organization_seat_usage;
```

**Recommended Schedule**: Every 15-30 minutes via cron job or pg_cron

**Implementation Options**:

1. **Supabase Edge Function** (recommended)
2. **External cron job** calling Supabase Management API
3. **pg_cron extension** (if enabled in Supabase project)

**Example Edge Function**:
```typescript
// Edge Function: refresh-seat-usage
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

Deno.serve(async (req) => {
  const supabase = createClient(
    Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_URL')!,
    Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY')!
  )

  const { error } = await supabase.rpc('refresh_organization_seat_usage')

  return new Response(
    JSON.stringify({ success: !error, error: error?.message }),
    { headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }
  )
})
```

## Security Benefits

### Before (Insecure)

- ‚ùå Any authenticated user could query ALL organizations' seat usage
- ‚ùå No access control based on organization membership
- ‚ùå Potential data leak vulnerability
- ‚ùå Violates principle of least privilege

### After (Secure)

- ‚úÖ Users can ONLY see organizations they belong to
- ‚úÖ Access control enforced at database level
- ‚úÖ SQL injection protected (search_path security)
- ‚úÖ Audit trail via function execution logs
- ‚úÖ Follows principle of least privilege

## Audit Trail

### Manual Audit Commands

To verify the security model after deployment:

```sql
-- Check materialized view permissions
SELECT
  grantee,
  privilege_type,
  is_grantable
FROM information_schema.role_table_grants
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name = 'organization_seat_usage'
ORDER BY grantee;

-- Check function permissions
SELECT
  grantee,
  privilege_type,
  is_grantable
FROM information_schema.routine_privileges
WHERE routine_schema = 'public'
AND routine_name = 'get_organization_seat_usage'
ORDER BY grantee;

-- Test function access (should succeed for member, fail for non-member)
SELECT * FROM get_organization_seat_usage(NULL);
SELECT * FROM get_organization_seat_usage('some-org-id');

-- Test direct view access (should fail)
SELECT * FROM organization_seat_usage; -- Should return permission denied
```

3. **Update Documentation**: Add wrapper function to API documentation
4. **Setup Refresh Job**: Implement periodic materialized view refresh
5. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for any access denied errors (expected behavior)
