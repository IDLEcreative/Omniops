## 🚀 Next Steps - Start Testing!

### Step 1: Restart Your Dev Server (REQUIRED)
The environment variables have been updated, so you **must restart** your dev server:

```bash
# Press Ctrl+C in your terminal running npm run dev
# Then start it again:
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Keep Webhook Forwarding Running
I've already started webhook forwarding in the background. To check if it's running:

```bash
ps aux | grep "stripe listen"
```

If you need to start it manually later:
```bash
./scripts/stripe/setup-webhook.sh
```

### Step 3: Test the Billing Flow! 🎯

1. **Open your browser**: http://localhost:3000/billing

2. **Click "Select Plan"** on the Starter plan

3. **Complete checkout** using test card:
   ```
   Card Number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
   Expiry: Any future date (e.g., 12/34)
   CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
   ZIP: Any 5 digits (e.g., 12345)
   ```

4. **Verify success**:
   - You should be redirected back to `/billing?success=true`
   - Subscription should show as "Active"
   - Check terminal for webhook event: `checkout.session.completed`

## 🧪 Test Cards

Stripe provides several test cards for different scenarios:

| Card Number | Scenario |
|-------------|----------|
| `4242 4242 4242 4242` | ✅ Success |
| `4000 0000 0000 9995` | ❌ Declined |
| `4000 0025 0000 3155` | 🔐 Requires authentication (3D Secure) |
| `4000 0000 0000 0341` | ❌ Expired card |

Use any future expiry date, any 3-digit CVC, and any 5-digit ZIP.

## 📝 What Happens During Checkout

1. **User clicks "Select Plan"** → Creates Stripe Checkout session
2. **Redirects to Stripe** → Secure payment page (hosted by Stripe)
3. **User enters card details** → Stripe processes payment
4. **Payment succeeds** → Stripe sends webhook to your server
5. **Webhook handler** → Saves subscription to database
6. **User redirects back** → Sees "Active" subscription status

All webhooks are **idempotent** (duplicate-safe) and **signature-verified** for security.

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Can't connect to dev server"
- Make sure you restarted after updating `.env.local`
- Check: `npm run dev` is running on port 3000

### "Webhook events not received"
- Check if `stripe listen` is still running
- Restart webhook forwarding: `./scripts/stripe/setup-webhook.sh`

### "Invalid price ID"
- Verify `.env.local` has correct price IDs (no placeholders)
- Restart dev server after updating

### "TypeScript errors"
- Already fixed ✅ (API version corrected)
- If new errors appear: `npm install`
