---

### Step 2: Run CI/CD Tests

**Expected CI/CD Checks:**
1. ✅ **Unit Tests** - Should pass (37 tests verified locally)
2. ✅ **Integration Tests** - Should pass (requires network access)
3. ✅ **Build** - Should succeed (TypeScript compilation verified)
4. ✅ **Lint** - Should pass (ESLint clean)

**Monitor CI/CD logs for:**
- RLS integration tests passing (16 tests in `__tests__/api/customer-config/`)
- Database connection successful
- No unexpected test failures

---

### Step 3: Merge to Main

**Prerequisites:**
- ✅ All CI/CD checks passing
- ✅ Code review approved
- ✅ No merge conflicts

**Merge Strategy:** Squash and merge (consolidates commits)

---

### Step 4: Deploy to Production

**Database Migrations (Already Applied in Dev):**
1. ✅ `20251029_drop_conversations_customer_id.sql` (drop dead column)
2. ✅ `20251029_rename_scraper_customer_id.sql` (rename for clarity)
3. ✅ Customer_id → organization_id backfill (33,584 rows)

**Deployment Command:**
```bash
# Via Vercel, Heroku, or your deployment platform
vercel --prod  # Or equivalent
```

---

## Post-Deployment Monitoring (24 Hours)

### Critical Metrics to Watch

#### 1. **Application Health** (First 15 Minutes)
**Check:**
- [ ] Application starts without errors
- [ ] Homepage loads successfully
- [ ] Dashboard loads without 500 errors

**Commands:**
```bash
# Check application logs
vercel logs --prod  # Or equivalent

# Monitor error rate
# Should be near 0 for first 15 minutes
```

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ 500 errors on dashboard
- ❌ "organization_id" null errors in logs
- ❌ Debug endpoints returning data (should be 404)

---

#### 2. **Database Performance** (First Hour)

**Check:**
- [ ] Dashboard loads in <1 second
- [ ] No N+1 query warnings in logs
- [ ] Database connections remain stable

**SQL Queries to Run:**
```sql
-- Verify organization_id population (should be 100%)
SELECT
  'conversations' as table_name,
  COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT(organization_id) as with_org_id,
  ROUND(COUNT(organization_id) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as percent
FROM conversations
UNION ALL
SELECT 'messages', COUNT(*), COUNT(organization_id),
  ROUND(COUNT(organization_id) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2)
FROM messages
UNION ALL
SELECT 'page_embeddings', COUNT(*), COUNT(organization_id),
  ROUND(COUNT(organization_id) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2)
FROM page_embeddings;
```

**Expected Results:** 100.00% for all tables

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ < 100% organization_id population
- ❌ Dashboard queries taking > 2 seconds
- ❌ Database connection pool exhaustion

---

#### 3. **Security** (First Hour)

**Check:**
- [ ] Debug endpoints return 404 in production
- [ ] Customer config APIs require authentication
- [ ] No unauthorized cross-organization access

**Test Commands:**
```bash
# All should return 404 in production
curl -I https://yourdomain.com/api/debug/example.com
curl -I https://yourdomain.com/api/test-rag
curl -I https://yourdomain.com/api/test-db

# Should return 401 Unauthorized (not 200)
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/customer/config/get
```

**Expected Results:**
- Debug endpoints: HTTP 404
- Auth-required endpoints: HTTP 401

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ Debug endpoints returning HTTP 200 with data
- ❌ Auth endpoints accessible without token
- ❌ Cross-organization data visible

---

#### 4. **Performance Metrics** (24 Hours)

**Monitor Dashboard (Supabase/Vercel/Your Platform):**

| Metric | Target | Check Frequency |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| **Dashboard Load Time** | <500ms (p95) | Every hour |
| **API Response Time** | <200ms (p95) | Every hour |
| **Database Query Count** | 3-4 per request | Every 4 hours |
| **Error Rate** | <0.1% | Continuously |
| **CPU Usage** | <70% | Every 4 hours |
| **Memory Usage** | <80% | Every 4 hours |

**Query to Monitor Performance:**
```sql
-- Check average query execution time
SELECT
  query,
  AVG(execution_time) as avg_ms,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE query LIKE '%organization_id%'
GROUP BY query
ORDER BY avg_ms DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ Dashboard load time >1 second consistently
- ❌ Error rate >1%
- ❌ Memory usage >90%

---

#### 5. **User Impact** (24 Hours)

**Monitor User-Facing Metrics:**
- [ ] User login success rate >99%
- [ ] Chat widget loads successfully
- [ ] Dashboard data displays correctly
- [ ] No customer complaints

**Check:**
```bash
# Monitor user activity logs
# Should show normal activity patterns
grep "user_login" production.log | tail -100

# Check for customer support tickets
# Should be 0 related to this deployment
```

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ Spike in support tickets
- ❌ User reports of missing data
- ❌ Login failures

---

## Rollback Plan (If Issues Occur)

### Critical Issues That Require Rollback
1. ❌ **Dashboard completely broken** (500 errors)
2. ❌ **organization_id null errors** in production
3. ❌ **Data loss** or corruption detected
4. ❌ **Security breach** (debug endpoints exposed)

### Rollback Procedure

#### Option 1: Revert Deployment (Fastest)
```bash
# Revert to previous deployment
vercel rollback  # Or equivalent

# Time: ~2 minutes
```

#### Option 2: Revert Database Migrations (If Needed)
```sql
-- If organization_id issues occur, these are already applied
-- and working, so rollback NOT recommended unless critical

-- Emergency: Recreate conversations.customer_id if needed
ALTER TABLE conversations
ADD COLUMN customer_id UUID REFERENCES customer_configs(id);

-- Backfill from domain_id
UPDATE conversations c
SET customer_id = d.customer_config_id
FROM domains d
WHERE c.domain_id = d.id;
```

**⚠️ Warning:** Database rollback should be LAST RESORT only. The migrations
were tested and validated. Application rollback should fix most issues.
