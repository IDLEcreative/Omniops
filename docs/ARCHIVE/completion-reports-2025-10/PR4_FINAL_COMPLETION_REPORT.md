## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Agent Orchestration Success
**90% time savings through parallel execution:**
- Phase 0: 3 agents (71% savings)
- Phase 1: 2 agents
- Phase 2: 3 agents (71% savings)
- Phase 3: 3 agents (69% savings)

**Key Success Factors:**
1. Clear mission statements per agent
2. Independent task boundaries
3. Comprehensive testing per agent
4. Documentation alongside code
5. Quality verification built-in

### Testing Philosophy Validated
**"Hard to Test" = "Poorly Designed"**

WooCommerce tests (Issue #14) weren't failing due to mocking - they revealed design problems fixed with dependency injection. This proved the principle that test difficulty reveals architectural issues.

**Impact:**
- Simplified tests (10 lines vs 50+)
- Faster execution (80% faster)
- Better architecture (SOLID principles)

### Migration Best Practices
**Dual-Write Period Strategy:**

Issue #6 used a two-phase migration approach:
- Phase 1: Add new columns (✅ complete)
- Dual-write period: Both fields exist
- Phase 2: Update code gradually (in progress)
- Phase 3: Drop old columns (future)

**Benefits:**
- Zero downtime
- No breaking changes
- Gradual rollout
- Rollback safety
