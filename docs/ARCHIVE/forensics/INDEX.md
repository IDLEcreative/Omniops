# Forensic Reports Archive

This directory contains historical forensic investigation reports that were moved from the root directory to maintain a clean project structure.

**Archive Date:** October 24, 2025
**Files Archived:** 11 forensic reports
**Reason:** Historical documentation cleanup - these reports represent past investigations that have been completed and resolved.

## What's Here

These are deep-dive forensic reports investigating specific bugs, performance issues, and system failures that occurred during development. They document:

- Root cause analysis of embedding failures
- Database query performance investigations
- Docker build optimization research
- Product search accuracy debugging
- Next.js 15 migration issues

## Files Archived (11 total)

- `ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS_EMBEDDING_FAILURE.md` - Root cause of embedding system failures
- `INDEX_FORENSIC_REPORT.md` - Database index performance forensics

### Product & Search Issues
- `DC66-10P-FORENSIC-REPORT.md` - Specific product lookup failure investigation
- `POST_PROCESSOR_FORENSIC_REPORT.md` - Post-processing pipeline issues

### Infrastructure & Build

## Git History Preserved

All files were moved using `git mv` to preserve their complete commit history. To view the history of any archived file:

```bash
git log --follow docs/ARCHIVE/forensics/[filename]
```

## Why These Were Archived

These reports served their purpose during active debugging but are no longer needed in the root directory:

1. **Issues Resolved:** All investigated problems have been fixed
2. **Historical Value:** Useful for reference but not active development
3. **Clean Root:** Keeps the root directory focused on current, actionable documentation
4. **Preservation:** Git history is fully preserved for future reference

- **Active Documentation:** See root directory for current project documentation (README.md, CLAUDE.md, etc.)
