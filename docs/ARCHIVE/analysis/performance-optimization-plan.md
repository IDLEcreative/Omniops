PHASE 1: IMMEDIATE FIXES (1-2 days)
------------------------------------
1. Implement Response Streaming
   - Use Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming OpenAI responses
   - Show typing indicator immediately
   - Stream tokens as they arrive
   - Expected improvement: 50% perceived latency reduction

2. Add Redis Response Cache
   - Cache full responses for common queries
   - TTL: 1 hour for dynamic content, 24 hours for static
   - Expected improvement: 90% faster for cached queries

3. Optimize Database Queries
   - Add indexes on frequently queried columns
   - Use connection pooling (max 20 connections)
   - Expected improvement: 30% reduction in DB latency

PHASE 2: ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENTS (3-5 days)
----------------------------------------------
1. Implement Query Queue System
   - Use Redis Bull for job queuing
   - Process heavy operations asynchronously
   - Return job ID for status polling
   - Expected improvement: Handle 10x more concurrent requests

2. Add Embedding Cache Layer
   - Pre-compute and cache embeddings
   - Store in Redis with vector similarity
   - Expected improvement: 70% faster similarity search

3. Implement Request Batching
   - Batch OpenAI API calls (up to 20 requests)
   - Batch database operations
   - Expected improvement: 40% reduction in API costs

PHASE 3: SCALABILITY ENHANCEMENTS (1 week)
-------------------------------------------
1. Edge Function Deployment
   - Deploy chat API to edge locations
   - Use Vercel Edge Functions or Cloudflare Workers
   - Expected improvement: 60% latency reduction globally

2. Implement Read Replicas
   - Set up Supabase read replicas
   - Route read queries to replicas
   - Expected improvement: 2x read throughput

3. Add CDN and Static Optimization
   - Cache widget assets on CDN
   - Implement service worker for offline support
   - Expected improvement: 80% faster widget load
