## Git History Preserved

All files were moved using `git mv` to preserve their complete commit history. To view the history of any archived file:

```bash
git log --follow docs/ARCHIVE/analysis/[filename]
```

## Why These Were Archived

These reports served their purpose during active development but are no longer needed in the root directory:

1. **Work Completed:** All implementations, fixes, and analyses are finished
2. **Historical Reference:** Valuable for understanding project evolution
3. **Clean Root:** Maintains focus on current, actionable documentation
4. **Full Preservation:** Git history ensures nothing is lost

## Accessing Archived Reports

All files are still fully accessible and searchable:

```bash
# Search all archived reports
grep -r "keyword" docs/ARCHIVE/analysis/

# View specific report
cat docs/ARCHIVE/analysis/FILENAME.md

# View commit history
git log --follow docs/ARCHIVE/analysis/FILENAME.md
```
