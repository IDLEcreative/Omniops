# Stock Checking Fix Summary

## ✅ Issue Fixed

The chat system was incorrectly configured to NOT check stock, even though it had access to WooCommerce stock data all along.

## What Was Wrong

The system prompt in `/app/api/chat-intelligent/route.ts` was telling the AI:
- "NEVER claim to check live stock"
- "When users ask about stock, defer to contacting the store"
- "DO NOT pretend to access live inventory systems"

But the system ACTUALLY had:
- Real-time stock status from WooCommerce (`stock_status` field)
- Product availability data in every search
- Full capability to report stock levels

## What Was Fixed

Updated the system prompt to correctly use WooCommerce stock data:

### Before:
```
- NEVER claim to check live stock
- Say "I'll need to check our current stock for you"
- Direct users to contact store for verification
```

### After:
```
- WooCommerce provides real-time stock status
- If stock_status is "instock": Say "✓ This item is currently in stock"
- If stock_status is "outofstock": Say "✗ This item is currently out of stock"
- You CAN check and report stock status from WooCommerce data
```

## Test Results

All stock checking tests now pass:
- ✅ Products show with stock indicators (✓/✗)
- ✅ When asked "is item X in stock?", gives actual status
- ✅ Reports "currently in stock" or "currently out of stock"
- ✅ No longer says "I can't check live stock"

## Architecture Notes

### Current Setup
- **WooCommerce Integration**: Fully functional via `searchProductsDynamic()`
- **Stock Data**: Retrieved in `stock_status` field for every product
- **WooCommerce Agent**: Exists at `/lib/agents/woocommerce-agent.ts` but not fully integrated

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Better Agent Integration**: The WooCommerce agent should be properly integrated into the chat-intelligent route for more sophisticated commerce operations

2. **Add Dedicated Stock Tool**: Consider adding a specific tool for checking stock of individual SKUs:
```typescript
{
  name: "check_stock",
  description: "Check real-time stock status for specific products",
  parameters: {
    sku: "Product SKU or ID",
    includeQuantity: "Whether to include exact quantity"
  }
}
```

3. **Enhanced Stock Information**: The WooCommerce API supports:
   - `stock_quantity`: Exact number in stock
   - `manage_stock`: Whether stock is tracked
   - `backorders`: Backorder status
   - Consider exposing these for richer stock information

## Summary

The system always had the capability to check stock through WooCommerce - it was just configured not to use it. Now it correctly:
- Shows stock status for all products
- Reports actual availability when asked
- Uses the WooCommerce data it receives

No additional API calls or infrastructure changes were needed - just correcting the system prompt to use the data it already had access to.
