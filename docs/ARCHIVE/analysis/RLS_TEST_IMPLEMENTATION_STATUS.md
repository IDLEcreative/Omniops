# RLS Test Implementation Status

**Date:** 2025-10-22
**Priority:** CRITICAL SECURITY

## Summary

Successfully transformed the multi-tenant isolation test suite from a non-functional security test (using service role keys that bypass RLS) to a proper RLS testing framework. However, the implementation requires Supabase Auth configuration to be completed before the tests can run.

---

## What Was Completed ✅

### 1. Created RLS Test Helper Framework (`test-utils/rls-test-helpers.ts`)

**Purpose:** Provide reusable utilities for testing Row Level Security with actual user sessions.

**Key Functions Created:**
- `setupRLSTest()` - One-line test harness setup
- `expectRLSBlocked()` - Verify unauthorized access is prevented
- `expectRLSAllowed()` - Verify authorized access works
- `createUserClient()` - Create authenticated Supabase clients
- `createTestUser()` - Helper for test user creation
- `createTestOrganization()` - Helper for test org setup

**Status:** Framework complete, currently using mock implementations

### 2. Rewrote Multi-Tenant Isolation Tests

**File:** `__tests__/integration/multi-tenant-isolation.test.ts`

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Removed all service role key usage from test assertions
- ✅ Implemented `setupRLSTest()` for proper test isolation
- ✅ Updated all test cases to use `expectRLSBlocked()` and `expectRLSAllowed()`
- ✅ Fixed Supabase client imports to use `@/lib/supabase-server`
- ✅ Proper test data setup/teardown with service role admin client

**Test Coverage:**
- Organization isolation (customer configs, members)
- Conversation isolation (conversations, messages)
- Embeddings isolation (scraped pages, page embeddings)
- Query cache isolation

### 3. Fixed Rate Limiting (`lib/rate-limit.ts`)

**Issue:** Non-deterministic cleanup using `Math.random() < 0.01`
**Fix:** Deterministic cleanup every 100 requests
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE and tested

---

## What Still Needs to be Done ⚠️

### 1. Configure Supabase Auth for Testing

**Current Blocker:** Tests fail because Supabase Auth is not configured in the test environment.

**Error:**
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'id')
  at createTestOrganization (test-utils/rls-test-helpers.ts:180:28)
```

**Root Cause:** `createServiceRoleClient()` returns null in test environment

**Solution Required:**
1. Set up proper Supabase service role client for tests
2. Implement actual user creation via Supabase Auth Admin API
3. Update `createTestUser()` to create real auth users
4. Update `createUserClient()` to sign in with real credentials

**Files to Update:**
- `test-utils/rls-test-helpers.ts` (lines 55-75 for createTestUser)
- `test-utils/rls-test-helpers.ts` (lines 26-38 for createUserClient)

### 2. Standardize Supabase Imports Across Test Suite

**Issue:** 4+ different import patterns causing confusion

**Current Patterns:**
- ✅ `@/lib/supabase/server` (CORRECT)
- ❌ `@supabase/supabase-js` (direct SDK)
- ❌ `@/lib/supabase-server` (old path)

**Files to Update:** ~23 test files

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours with agent

### 3. Fix WooCommerce Provider Tests

**Issue:** Mocking inconsistencies causing test failures

**File:** `__tests__/lib/agents/providers/woocommerce-provider.test.ts`

**Required:** Coordinate with Supabase import standardization

**Estimated Time:** 30-60 minutes

## How to Complete This Work

### Option 1: Configure Supabase Auth (Recommended)

This is the proper solution that will actually test RLS policies.

**Steps:**
1. Ensure `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is set in test environment
2. Update `lib/supabase/server.ts` to work in test context
3. Implement real user creation in RLS test helpers:

```typescript
// In test-utils/rls-test-helpers.ts
export async function createTestUser(
  email: string,
  metadata: Record<string, any> = {}
): Promise<string> {
  const adminClient = await createServiceRoleClient();

  if (!adminClient) {
    throw new Error('Service role client required for test user creation');
  }

  const { data, error } = await adminClient.auth.admin.createUser({
    email,
    password: process.env.TEST_USER_PASSWORD || 'test-password-123',
    email_confirm: true,
    user_metadata: metadata
  });

  if (error) {
    throw new Error(`Failed to create test user: ${error.message}`);
  }

  return data.user.id;
}
```

4. Update `createUserClient()` to actually sign in:

```typescript
export async function createUserClient(
  userId: string,
  email: string
): Promise<SupabaseClient> {
  const client = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey);

  const { error } = await client.auth.signInWithPassword({
    email,
    password: process.env.TEST_USER_PASSWORD || 'test-password-123'
  });

  if (error) {
    throw new Error(`Failed to sign in test user: ${error.message}`);
  }

  return client;
}
```

5. Run tests: `npm run test:integration -- multi-tenant-isolation`

### Option 2: Temporary Mock Implementation (NOT RECOMMENDED)

This would make tests pass but wouldn't actually validate RLS. Only use if Option 1 is blocked.

**Warning:** This defeats the entire purpose of RLS testing and provides false security confidence.

---

## Security Impact

### Current State (Before This Work)
- ❌ Tests use service role keys
- ❌ RLS policies are completely bypassed
- ❌ No validation of cross-tenant isolation
- ❌ False sense of security

### After Option 1 (Proper Implementation)
- ✅ Tests use real user sessions
- ✅ RLS policies are actually enforced
- ✅ Cross-tenant access attempts fail as expected
- ✅ Actual security validation

### Why This Matters

Without proper RLS testing, you have **ZERO assurance** that:
- Organization A cannot access Organization B's data
- User sessions respect multi-tenant boundaries
- RLS policies are configured correctly
- Data leakage is prevented

**This is a critical security gap that must be fixed before production use.**

---

## Test Execution When Complete

```bash
# Run RLS tests
npm run test:integration -- multi-tenant-isolation

# Expected result: All tests pass
# Expected warnings: NONE (currently shows mock warnings)
```

**Success Criteria:**
- No mock user warnings
- All 8 test cases pass
- Tests actually attempt unauthorized access and verify it fails
- Test cleanup works properly

## Questions & Next Steps

1. **When will Supabase Auth be configured for testing?**
   - This blocks proper RLS test execution
   - Without it, we have no real security testing

2. **Should we use Option 1 or Option 2?**
   - Option 1 (proper auth) is strongly recommended
   - Option 2 (mocks) provides no security value

3. **Who owns completing this work?**
   - Requires access to Supabase service role keys
   - Requires knowledge of test environment setup

---

## Critical Warning ⚠️

**DO NOT mark RLS testing as "complete" without implementing Option 1.**

The current implementation is a framework that **cannot validate security** until Supabase Auth is configured. Mocked tests provide a false sense of security and should never be used in production.

**The multi-tenant isolation tests must use real user sessions or they are worthless.**
