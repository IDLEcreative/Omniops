# UX Impact Analysis: Removing Forced Response Templates

## Executive Summary

The removal of forced response templates in Phase 2 represents a fundamental shift from **robotic scripting** to **intelligent conversation**. This change will dramatically improve customer satisfaction by enabling natural, empathetic, and contextually appropriate responses.

## Current State: Template-Forced Responses (Lines 121-160)

The current implementation forces exact phrasing for common queries:

### Rigid Template Examples:
```
Customer: "show me my recent orders"
Forced Response: "I'd be happy to help you with your recent orders. To look these up for you, I'll need your email address or order number please."

Customer: "MY ORDER IS LATE!"
Forced Response: "I can help you track your order. Please provide your order number or email address so I can look it up and check the status."
```

## Future State: Intelligent Natural Responses
