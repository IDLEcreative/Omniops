# Docker Performance Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive performance profiling of the Omniops Docker infrastructure reveals significant optimization opportunities. The application currently uses a well-optimized multi-stage build with BuildKit cache mounts, Alpine base images, and proper security practices. However, the 1.2GB image size and 49-second cached build times indicate room for improvement.

## Performance Metrics

### 1. Build Performance

| Metric | Measurement | Status |
|--------|------------|---------|
| **No-cache Build** | 120.76s | ⚠️ Acceptable but could be optimized |
| **Cached Build** | 49.03s | ⚠️ Should be under 30s |
| **BuildKit Build** | 46.79s | ✅ 4.6% improvement over standard |
| **Build Context Size** | 1.5GB | ❌ Too large, needs .dockerignore optimization |
| **Cache Improvement** | 59.4% | ✅ Good cache utilization |

**Key Findings:**
- BuildKit provides modest 4.6% improvement over standard cached builds
- Build context at 1.5GB is excessive and slows initial build stage
- Cache provides excellent 59.4% improvement over cold builds

### 2. Image Size Analysis

| Image | Size | Assessment |
|-------|------|------------|
| **omniops-app** | 1.2GB | ❌ Large - target should be < 500MB |
| **redis:7-alpine** | 61.4MB | ✅ Optimal |
| **Layer Count** | 27 | ✅ Acceptable |

**Largest Components:**
- Node.js runtime and dependencies dominate image size
- Multiple worker images (scraping, embeddings, woocommerce) at ~2-3GB each
- Total Docker storage footprint exceeds 10GB

### 3. Container Startup Performance

| Metric | Time | Target | Status |
|--------|------|--------|--------|
| **docker-compose up** | 11.20s | < 10s | ✅ Good |
| **Time to Healthy** | 0.11s | < 5s | ✅ Excellent |
| **First API Response** | 1.38s | < 2s | ✅ Good |
| **Health Check Latency** | 244ms | < 500ms | ✅ Good |

**Startup Resource Usage:**
- CPU at startup: ~1.1%
- Memory at startup: 150MB (app), 15MB (Redis)
- Both containers achieve healthy status quickly

### 4. Runtime Performance

| Metric | Measurement | Assessment |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Health Check Response** | 244ms avg | ✅ Good latency |
| **Memory Usage (stable)** | 123.3MB | ✅ Efficient |
| **CPU Usage (idle)** | 0.01% | ✅ Excellent |
| **Redis Memory** | 15.57MB | ✅ Minimal footprint |
| **Container Restart** | ~10-15s | ✅ Acceptable |

### 5. Resource Utilization

| Resource | Current | Optimization Potential |
|----------|---------|------------------------|
| **CPU Limits** | None set | Consider setting limits |
| **Memory Limits** | None set | Consider 512MB limit |
| **Network I/O** | 83KB/45KB | Minimal overhead |
| **Disk I/O** | 6.21MB/0B | Low impact |

## Dockerfile Optimization Analysis

### Current Optimizations ✅
- **Multi-stage build**: 3 stages (deps, builder, runner)
- **BuildKit cache mounts**: Enabled for npm cache
- **Alpine base**: Using node:20-alpine for minimal size
- **Non-root user**: Security best practice implemented
- **Health check**: Configured with proper intervals

### Areas for Improvement ❌
- 8 RUN commands could be consolidated
- 9 COPY commands might be optimized
- No explicit layer squashing
- Missing standalone mode optimization

## Performance Bottleneck Analysis

### 1. **Image Size (Critical)**
**Current**: 1.2GB  
**Target**: < 500MB  
**Impact**: Slow pulls, high storage costs, slower deployments

**Root Causes:**
- Full Next.js build artifacts included
- Development dependencies potentially leaked
- No tree-shaking of unused code
- Large node_modules even after pruning

### 2. **Build Context (High Priority)**
**Current**: 1.5GB  
**Target**: < 100MB  
**Impact**: Every build transfers 1.5GB to Docker daemon

**Root Causes:**
- Missing or incomplete .dockerignore
- Git history included
- Test files and documentation included
- Local development artifacts

### 3. **Build Time (Medium Priority)**
**Current**: 49s cached  
**Target**: < 30s  
**Impact**: Slower CI/CD, developer friction

**Root Causes:**
- Large dependency installation
- Unoptimized layer ordering
- Rebuild of unchanged layers

## Optimization Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Quick Wins)

1. **Optimize .dockerignore**
```dockerignore
# Add to .dockerignore
.git
.github
docs
test*
*.test.*
*.spec.*
coverage
.env*
*.md
docker-performance*
profile-docker*
CLAUDE.md
```
**Expected Impact**: Reduce build context from 1.5GB to ~100MB

2. **Enable BuildKit by Default**
```bash
# Add to shell profile
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
```
**Expected Impact**: 5-10% build time improvement

3. **Implement Standalone Build**
```dockerfile
# In Dockerfile, ensure standalone is configured
RUN npm run build && \
    npm prune --production
```
**Expected Impact**: Reduce image size by 30-40%

### Short-term Optimizations (1-2 days)

4. **Layer Consolidation**
```dockerfile
# Combine RUN commands
RUN apk add --no-cache libc6-compat curl && \
    addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs && \
    adduser --system --uid 1001 nextjs
```
**Expected Impact**: Reduce layers, improve cache efficiency

5. **Multi-stage Optimization**
```dockerfile
# Add pruning stage
FROM node:20-alpine AS pruner
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
```
**Expected Impact**: 200-300MB size reduction

6. **Use Distroless Base**
```dockerfile
FROM gcr.io/distroless/nodejs20-debian11

```
**Expected Impact**: 50-70% size reduction

8. **Cache Mount Optimization**
```dockerfile
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm \
    --mount=type=cache,target=/app/.next/cache \
    npm ci && npm run build
```
**Expected Impact**: 20-30% build time improvement

9. **Separate Static Assets**
- Serve static files from CDN
- Remove public/ from container
**Expected Impact**: 100-200MB reduction

### Long-term Optimizations (2-4 weeks)

10. **Microservice Decomposition**
- Separate scraper, embeddings, and WooCommerce workers
- Independent scaling and deployment
**Expected Impact**: Better resource utilization, faster deployments

11. **Native Dependencies Optimization**
- Replace heavy dependencies with lighter alternatives
- Tree-shake unused code more aggressively
**Expected Impact**: 200-400MB reduction

12. **Container Registry Caching**
- Implement registry-based layer caching
- Use GitHub Actions cache or similar
**Expected Impact**: 70% build time reduction in CI/CD

## Comparison with Industry Standards

| Metric | Current | Industry Best | Gap |
|--------|---------|---------------|-----|
| **Node.js App Size** | 1.2GB | 200-400MB | 3-6x larger |
| **Build Time (cached)** | 49s | 15-30s | 1.6-3x slower |
| **Startup Time** | 11.2s | 5-10s | Within range |
| **Memory Usage** | 123MB | 100-200MB | ✅ Optimal |

## Cost Impact Analysis

### Current State
- **Storage**: 10GB+ total Docker images = ~$0.50/month per instance
- **Transfer**: 1.2GB per deployment = ~$0.12 per deployment
- **Build Time**: 49s × hourly deployments = 13.6 hours/year compute

### After Optimization
- **Storage**: 3GB total (-70%) = ~$0.15/month
- **Transfer**: 400MB per deployment (-66%) = ~$0.04 per deployment  
- **Build Time**: 20s (-59%) = 5.5 hours/year compute

### Annual Savings (100 deployments/month)
- Storage: $4.20/year
- Transfer: $96/year
- Compute: 8.1 hours = ~$50/year
- **Total: ~$150/year per environment**

## Monitoring & Validation

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Build Time**: Target < 30s cached
2. **Image Size**: Target < 500MB

4. **Container Start**: Target < 10s
5. **Memory Usage**: Keep < 200MB

### Validation Script
```bash

# Compare metrics in docker-performance-quick-report.json
```

## Conclusion

The Omniops Docker infrastructure demonstrates good foundational practices but has significant optimization opportunities. The primary bottleneck is the 1.2GB image size, which impacts deployment speed and storage costs. With the recommended optimizations, we can achieve:

- **65% reduction in image size** (1.2GB → 400MB)
- **40% reduction in build time** (49s → 30s)  
- **70% reduction in build context** (1.5GB → 100MB)
- **$150/year cost savings** per environment

The optimizations maintain all security best practices while improving performance across all metrics. Start with quick wins (.dockerignore, BuildKit) for immediate impact, then progressively implement deeper optimizations based on your deployment frequency and scale requirements.
