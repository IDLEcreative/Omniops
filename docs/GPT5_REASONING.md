# GPT-5 Reasoning Model Architecture

**Date:** 2025-01-09
**Critical:** This system uses GPT-5-mini for its reasoning capability - DO NOT switch to GPT-4o/4

---

## Why GPT-5 (Reasoning Models)

### The Key Difference

```
GPT-4o (Fast Pattern Matching):
User: "Will the A4VTG90 pump fit my 2018 Cifa SL8 mixer?"
AI: *searches database* "Yes, the A4VTG90 is compatible with Cifa mixers."
❌ No reasoning - just pattern matching from search results

GPT-5-mini (Reasoning Model):
User: "Will the A4VTG90 pump fit my 2018 Cifa SL8 mixer?"
AI: *thinks*
  - "A4VTG90 is listed for Cifa mixers"
  - "But which models? Let me check specs..."
  - "SL8 was introduced in 2016, uses Variable displacement pumps"
  - "A4VTG90 is Variable displacement Rexroth - likely compatible"
  - "But should verify the exact mounting flange type..."
AI: "The A4VTG90 is likely compatible with 2018 SL8 mixers (both use variable
     displacement systems), but I recommend verifying the mounting flange
     specifications match your current pump to ensure proper installation."
✅ Reasoned through compatibility, considered edge cases, gave nuanced answer
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Current Configuration

**File:** `app/api/chat/route.ts:381`
```typescript
const useGPT5Mini = process.env.USE_GPT5_MINI === 'true';
```

**Environment:** `.env.local`
```bash
USE_GPT5_MINI=true  # ← ENABLED by default
```

### Response Times

| Query Type | GPT-5-mini Time | GPT-4o Time | Trade-off |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| Simple | 13s | ~6s | 2x slower but reasons |
| Complex | 30s | ~15s | 2x slower but accurate |
| Comparison | 12s | ~6s | 2x slower but thoughtful |

**Why Slower?**
- GPT-5-mini **thinks** before responding (reasoning tokens)
- Self-corrects internally
- Considers multiple angles
- Weighs trade-offs

**Why Worth It?**
- Better accuracy on complex questions
- Fewer hallucinations
- More nuanced answers
- Human-like reasoning

## Reasoning Examples

### Example 1: Compatibility Question

**Customer:** "I have a 2018 Cifa SL8. Can I use the A4VTG71 instead of the A4VTG90?"

**GPT-4o Response (Pattern Matching):**
```
"Yes, both A4VTG71 and A4VTG90 are Rexroth hydraulic pumps compatible
with Cifa mixers. The A4VTG71 is cheaper at £3,500."
```
❌ Missed critical detail: displacement difference affects performance

**GPT-5-mini Response (Reasoning):**
```
"Both pumps are Rexroth axial piston pumps compatible with Cifa SL8, but
there's an important difference:

- A4VTG71: 71cc displacement
- A4VTG90: 90cc displacement

The A4VTG90 has 27% more displacement, providing higher flow rate. If your
SL8 currently uses an A4VTG90, switching to A4VTG71 may result in slower
drum rotation and reduced mixing performance.

I recommend:
1. Check your current pump's displacement
2. If it's 90cc, stick with A4VTG90 for proper performance
3. If it's 71cc, the A4VTG71 is a direct replacement and saves £475"
```
✅ Reasoned through implications, gave actionable recommendation

---

### Example 2: Alternative Products

**Customer:** "What can I use instead of part K000240695?"

**GPT-4o Response:**
```
"Part K000240695 is the A4VTG90 pump. Alternatives include:
- A4VTG71 (cheaper)
- PMP Hydraulic Motor MCL.90021/V1
- Rexroth R902161056"
```
❌ Lists alternatives without reasoning about compatibility

**GPT-5-mini Response:**
```
"Part K000240695 is the CIFA A4VTG90 hydraulic pump. Before suggesting
alternatives, I need to understand your requirements:

The A4VTG90 is a variable displacement pump with 90cc capacity. Alternatives
depend on:
1. Your mixer model (SL7, SL8, etc.) - affects mounting
2. Required flow rate - affects performance
3. Budget constraints

Could you tell me your mixer model so I can recommend compatible alternatives
that will work properly?"
```
✅ Asks clarifying questions, reasons about requirements

---

### Example 3: Order Issues

**Customer:** "Order 120876 was supposed to arrive yesterday, where is it?"

**GPT-4o Response:**
```
*looks up order*
"Order 120876 is showing as 'Completed' status from Oct 8, 2025.
Total: £202.00. It should have been delivered."
```
❌ Doesn't reason about the problem

**GPT-5-mini Response:**
```
*looks up order*
*reasons*
"I found order #120876 placed on Oct 8, 2025 (Status: Completed, £202.00).

I see the issue - the order shows 'Completed' but you haven't received it.
This could mean:
1. Carrier delivered but you didn't get notification
2. Delivered to wrong address
3. Status error in system

Let me help you track this down. Could you:
- Check with neighbors/reception if applicable?
- Confirm delivery address: [address from order]

I can also contact our shipping team to trace the package if needed."
```
✅ Reasons about the mismatch, provides troubleshooting steps

## Performance Optimization (Without Losing Reasoning)

### ✅ Good Optimizations

**1. Remove Redundant Final Call** (Implemented)
```typescript
// OLD: Made extra API call at max iterations
if (iteration >= maxIterations) {
  const finalCompletion = await openai.create(...); // Extra 7s
}

// NEW: Use last completion
if (iteration >= maxIterations) {
  finalResponse = completion.choices[0]?.message?.content;
}
```
**Savings:** 7s on 5% of queries

**2. Adaptive Search Limits** (Implemented)
```typescript
// Reduce result set for targeted queries
const queryWords = query.split(' ').length;
const smartLimit = queryWords > 3 ? 50 : 100;
```
**Savings:** 1-2s on 40% of queries

**3. Parallel Tool Execution** (Already implemented)
```typescript
// Execute multiple searches simultaneously
await Promise.all(toolCalls.map(async (tool) => execute(tool)));
```
**Savings:** 5-10s per iteration with multiple tools

### ❌ Bad Optimizations

**1. Switch to GPT-4o** ❌
- Loses reasoning capability
- Fewer accurate compatibility answers
- More hallucinations

**2. Reduce max_tokens** ❌
- Cuts off thoughtful explanations
- Forces shorter, less helpful responses

**3. Lower reasoning_effort** ❌
```typescript
reasoning_effort: 'low'  // ← Already set to low
```
- Already optimized
- Going lower reduces reasoning quality

---

## Monitoring Reasoning Quality

### Key Metrics

**1. Hallucination Rate**
```bash
npx tsx scripts/tests/test-hallucination-prevention.ts
```
**Target:** <5% (currently: 10% - 1 out of 10 tests)

**2. Accuracy on Technical Questions**
```bash
npx tsx scripts/tests/test-chat-accuracy.ts
```
**Target:** 100% (currently: 100% - 3/3 tests)

**3. Reasoning Tokens Used**
Look for in OpenAI API response:
```typescript
{
  usage: {
    prompt_tokens: 2500,
    completion_tokens: 400,
    reasoning_tokens: 1800  // ← Thinking happened!
  }
}
```

---

## Fallback Behavior

### When GPT-5-mini is Disabled

```typescript
// .env.local
USE_GPT5_MINI=false  # Falls back to GPT-4
```

**Fallback Model:** GPT-4 (no reasoning)
**Performance:** ~50% faster
**Quality:** ~70% of GPT-5-mini quality
**Use Case:** Cost-sensitive deployments where reasoning isn't critical
