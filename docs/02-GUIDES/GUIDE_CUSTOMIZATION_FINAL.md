## The Philosophy

**We do the heavy lifting. Users just pick colors and personality.**

Every setting visible to users must answer: "Does a non-technical person need to control this?"

If no → It gets a smart default and stays hidden.

---

## Build Size

```bash
✅ Compiled successfully
├ ○ /dashboard/customize    14.3 kB
```

Clean. Fast. Simple.

---

## Access

```
http://localhost:3000/dashboard/customize
```

That's the only customization page. Period.

---

## What's Deleted

- ❌ `/dashboard/customize/advanced` (removed)
- ❌ `/dashboard/customize-v2` (removed)
- ❌ All old complex section components (removed)
- ❌ Export/import features (removed)
- ❌ Developer settings link (removed)
- ❌ Migration banners (removed)

---

## Success

**Elegant. Minimal. Just works.**

No power user mode.
No technical bloat.
No "if you need more control..." links.

We built a great default. That's all users need.
