## Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Silent Deploy (Week 1)

**Objective**: Deploy without user-facing changes, monitor system health

#### 1. Deploy to Staging
```bash
# Build and test
npm run build
npm run test:unit

# Deploy to staging environment
# (Your deployment command here)

# Verify health
curl https://staging.yourapp.com/api/health
```

**Validation**:
- [ ] Application starts successfully
- [ ] No error spikes in logs
- [ ] Registry detection working (check logs for provider resolution)
- [ ] Cache metrics available

#### 2. Monitor Metrics (24 hours)
**Key Metrics to Track**:
- Provider cache hit rate (target: >90%)
- Provider detection success rate (target: 100% for configured domains)
- Response time impact (target: <10ms increase)
- Error rate (target: 0 new errors)

**Where to Monitor**:
```typescript
// Add to your monitoring dashboard
- commerce_provider_cache_hits
- commerce_provider_detection_success
- commerce_provider_detection_time
- commerce_provider_errors
```

#### 3. Deploy to Production
```bash
# After 24h successful staging
# Deploy to production
# (Your production deployment command)

# Monitor for first 2 hours
# Watch error logs, cache metrics, response times
```

**Rollback Plan**:
If issues occur within first 2 hours:
```bash
# Revert to previous version
git revert <commit-hash>
npm run build
# Deploy previous version
```

### Phase 2: Gradual Enablement (Week 2-3)

**Objective**: Enable Shopify for pilot customers

#### 1. Select Pilot Customers
**Criteria**:
- [ ] Low to medium traffic (easier to monitor)
- [ ] Tech-savvy (can provide feedback)
- [ ] Currently using Shopify (natural fit)
- [ ] Willing to report issues quickly

**Enable via database**:
```sql
-- For each pilot customer
UPDATE customer_configs
SET
  shopify_enabled = true,
  shopify_shop = 'customer-shop.myshopify.com'
WHERE domain = 'pilot-customer.com';
```

#### 2. Monitor Pilot Performance (1 week)
**Daily Checks**:
- [ ] Review pilot customer feedback
- [ ] Check Shopify API call success rates
- [ ] Monitor product search accuracy
- [ ] Verify order lookup functionality
- [ ] Track response time impact

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] >95% Shopify API success rate
- [ ] <200ms average response time increase
- [ ] No customer complaints
- [ ] Positive feedback on product search

#### 3. Expand to More Customers
**Weekly expansion**:
- Week 2: 5 pilot customers
- Week 3: 20 customers
- Week 4: All Shopify customers

**Enable in batches**:
```sql
-- Batch 1: Top 5 Shopify customers
UPDATE customer_configs
SET shopify_enabled = true
WHERE shopify_shop IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 5;

-- Monitor for 48 hours, then continue
```

### Phase 3: Full Rollout (Week 4+)

**Objective**: Enable for all customers, marketing announcement

#### 1. Enable for All Customers
```sql
-- Enable Shopify for all configured shops
UPDATE customer_configs
SET shopify_enabled = true
WHERE shopify_shop IS NOT NULL;

-- Verify count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customer_configs WHERE shopify_enabled = true;
```

#### 2. Update Documentation
- [ ] Update customer-facing docs (if public)
- [ ] Add multi-platform support to marketing materials
- [ ] Create blog post announcing new feature
- [ ] Update demo environment with Shopify example

#### 3. Marketing Announcement
**Channels**:
- [ ] Email to existing customers
- [ ] Blog post on company website
- [ ] Social media announcement (Twitter, LinkedIn)
- [ ] Update documentation site

**Key Messages**:
- "Multi-platform commerce support now available"
- "Seamlessly supports WooCommerce AND Shopify"
- "Same great experience, more platforms"
- "Extensible architecture for future platforms"

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Week 1: Intensive Monitoring
**Daily checks**:
- [ ] Error rates (should remain flat)
- [ ] Response times (should remain <200ms increase)
- [ ] Cache hit rates (should be >90%)
- [ ] Provider detection failures (should be 0%)
- [ ] Customer feedback (should be positive/neutral)

**Automated Alerts**:
```yaml
# Example monitoring alert config
alerts:
  - name: "Commerce Provider Detection Failure"
    condition: "commerce_provider_errors > 5 per minute"
    action: "Page on-call engineer"

  - name: "Commerce Provider Slow Response"
    condition: "commerce_provider_detection_time > 1000ms"
    action: "Slack #engineering"

  - name: "Cache Hit Rate Low"
    condition: "commerce_provider_cache_hits < 80%"
    action: "Email team@yourcompany.com"
```

### Week 2-4: Standard Monitoring
**Weekly checks**:
- [ ] Review aggregated metrics
- [ ] Analyze cache effectiveness
- [ ] Identify slow providers (if any)
- [ ] Plan optimizations if needed

### Ongoing: Monthly Review
**Monthly checks**:
- [ ] Review provider distribution (Shopify vs WooCommerce %)
- [ ] Analyze platform-specific issues
- [ ] Plan new platform additions (BigCommerce, etc.)
- [ ] Optimize cache TTL if needed

## Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Rollback (Critical Issues)
**Trigger**: System down, >50% error rate, data corruption

```bash
# 1. Revert code
git revert <commerce-provider-commit>

# 2. Rebuild
npm run build

# 3. Deploy
# (Your deployment command)

# 4. Verify
curl https://yourapp.com/api/health

# 5. Notify team
# Post in Slack, update status page
```

### Gradual Rollback (Performance Issues)
**Trigger**: Slow responses, high resource usage, cache issues

```sql
-- 1. Disable Shopify for all customers
UPDATE customer_configs SET shopify_enabled = false;

-- 2. Monitor for 15 minutes
-- 3. If improved, root cause analysis
-- 4. If not improved, full code rollback
```

### Feature Disable (Compatibility Issues)
**Trigger**: Platform-specific bugs, API issues

```sql
-- Disable specific platform
UPDATE customer_configs
SET shopify_enabled = false
WHERE shopify_shop = 'problematic-shop.myshopify.com';

-- Keep WooCommerce active, investigate Shopify issue
```

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >90% (current: N/A, monitor after deploy)
- **Provider Detection Time**: <5ms avg (current: 3-5ms tested)
- **Error Rate**: <0.1% (current: 0%)
- **Response Time Impact**: <50ms increase (current: negligible)

### Business Metrics
- **Customer Adoption**: >50% of Shopify customers using feature (Week 4)
- **Customer Satisfaction**: >4.5/5 rating
- **Support Tickets**: <5 related issues per week
- **Platform Distribution**: Track WooCommerce vs Shopify usage

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Provider detection failure** | Low | High | Graceful fallback to semantic search |
| **Cache stampede** | Low | Medium | TTL jitter, staggered expiration |
| **Shopify API rate limits** | Medium | Medium | Implement rate limiting, cache aggressively |
| **Backward compatibility break** | Very Low | Critical | Extensive testing confirms no breaking changes |
| **Performance degradation** | Low | Medium | Caching prevents overhead, monitor closely |
