# Performance Optimization

**⚠️ THIS FILE HAS MOVED**

This documentation has been moved to the architecture section:

**New Location**: [docs/01-ARCHITECTURE/performance-optimization.md](./01-ARCHITECTURE/performance-optimization.md)

## Quick Links

- **[Performance Optimization Guide](./01-ARCHITECTURE/performance-optimization.md)** - Complete comprehensive guide
- **[Search Architecture](./SEARCH_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Search limits and result flow
- **[Hallucination Prevention](./02-FEATURES/chat-system/hallucination-prevention.md)** - Quality safeguards

## What Changed

The performance optimization documentation has been:
- ✅ **Expanded** from 614 lines to comprehensive 1200+ line guide
- ✅ **Reorganized** into 12 major sections with clear TOC
- ✅ **Enhanced** with real code examples and metrics
- ✅ **Updated** with current implementation details (GPT-5-mini, etc.)
- ✅ **Moved** to proper architecture documentation folder

## New Content Includes

1. **Overview & Performance Goals** - Current metrics and targets
2. **Architecture Overview** - System layers and considerations
3. **Database Optimizations** - Indexing, queries, pooling, pagination
4. **API Layer Optimizations** - Rate limiting, parallel processing, streaming
5. **Search & Embeddings Performance** - Hybrid search, caching, limits
6. **AI Model Optimization** - Model selection, iterations, token budgets
7. **Frontend Performance** - Bundle size, lazy loading, images
8. **Caching Strategies** - Multi-layer architecture, implementations
9. **Monitoring & Metrics** - Tools, telemetry, key metrics
10. **Testing Performance** - Load testing, benchmarks, A/B testing
11. **Implementation Roadmap** - 4-phase plan with time estimates
12. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions

## Performance Analysis (Historical)

The original analysis from 2025-01-09 has been preserved and expanded in the new document. Key findings:

- ✅ Iteration cap (3): Optimal and sufficient
- ✅ Content truncation (200 chars): Acceptable with 29.8% avg loss
- ⚠️ Response time (13-30s): Needs optimization (target: <15s)

**Recommendations implemented:**
- ✅ GPT-5-mini migration (83% cost reduction, 50% faster)
- ⚠️ Adaptive search limits (in progress)
- ⚠️ WooCommerce caching (in progress)
