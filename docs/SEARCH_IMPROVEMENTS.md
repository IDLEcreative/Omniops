# Search System Improvements

## Overview
This document describes the validated search improvements implemented to enhance the accuracy and recall of the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system, specifically addressing issues with product specification retrieval and general search quality.

## Problem Statement
The system was failing to retrieve complete product specifications (e.g., DC66-10P pump) due to:
1. High similarity threshold (0.7) filtering out relevant but lower-scoring content
2. Limited chunk retrieval (10-15 chunks) missing important context
3. Uniform content truncation not accounting for content type

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Lowered Similarity Threshold
**Change:** 0.7 → 0.45 (36% reduction)

**Files Modified:**
- `constants/index.ts`
- `lib/embeddings.ts`
- `lib/enhanced-embeddings.ts`
- `lib/chat-context-enhancer.ts`

**Impact:**
- Captures more relevant content that was previously filtered out
- Better recall for partial matches and semantically related content
- Reduces false negatives in search results

### 2. Increased Chunk Retrieval
**Changes:**
- Default chunks: 10-15 → 20-25 (67% increase)
- Minimum chunks: 8 → 15 (88% increase)
- Maximum chunks: 15 → 25 (67% increase)

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/enhanced-embeddings.ts`
- `lib/chat-context-enhancer.ts`
- `app/api/chat/route.ts`

**Impact:**
- More comprehensive context for AI model
- Better coverage of multi-faceted queries
- Improved accuracy for complex technical questions

### 3. Content-Type-Aware Truncation
**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Dynamic truncation based on content type
Products: 2000 chars      // Full specifications
Support/Help: 1200 chars   // Detailed solutions
Policy pages: 800 chars    // Key policy points
Blog posts: 1000 chars     // Main content
FAQs: No truncation       // Complete Q&A pairs
Contact info: No truncation // All contact details
```

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/chat/route.ts` (lines 920-944, 955-971)

**Impact:**
- Products get full specification details
- FAQs and contact info are never truncated
- Policy/blog content appropriately summarized

### 4. RPC Function Fallback
**Implementation:**
- Graceful fallback from `match_page_embeddings_extended` to `search_embeddings`
- Automatic detection and handling of missing RPC functions

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/enhanced-embeddings.ts` (lines 83-131)

**Impact:**
- Better compatibility across different Supabase configurations
- No failures due to missing database functions
- Maintains search functionality with fallback options

### 5. Enhanced Logging and Metrics
**Added Metrics:**
- Chunks retrieved count
- Average similarity scores
- Similarity distribution (high/medium/low)
- Content type distribution
- Performance timing

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/chat/route.ts` (lines 524-533)

## Testing and Validation

### Test Scripts Created:
1. `test-search-improvements.ts` - Comprehensive search testing
2. `test-improvements-summary.ts` - Verification and summary

### Verification Results:
✅ All 14 code checks passed
✅ All thresholds correctly updated
✅ Content truncation properly implemented
✅ Fallback mechanisms in place

## Expected Benefits

1. **Better Product Retrieval:** DC66-10P pump specifications and similar products now properly retrieved with full details
2. **Reduced "No Information" Responses:** Lower threshold captures more relevant content
3. **Improved Technical Accuracy:** More chunks provide complete technical context
4. **Content-Appropriate Responses:** FAQs get full content, products get specifications, policies get summaries
5. **Better Scalability:** Graceful fallbacks ensure system works across different configurations

## Backward Compatibility

All changes maintain backward compatibility:
- Existing API contracts unchanged
- Default parameters can be overridden
- Fallback mechanisms for missing features
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Performance Considerations

While retrieving more chunks and lowering thresholds:
- Token limits are still respected (MAX_TOKENS = 12000)
- Efficient truncation prevents context overflow
- Caching mechanisms remain in place
- Parallel processing for embedding generation

## Monitoring and Tuning

Monitor these metrics post-deployment:
```javascript
improvementMetrics: {
  chunksRetrieved: number,      // Target: 15-25
  avgSimilarity: number,         // Target: 0.55-0.75
  lowSimilarityChunks: number,   // Acceptable: 20-40%
  highSimilarityChunks: number,  // Target: 30-50%
}
```

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for further optimization:
1. Dynamic threshold adjustment based on query type
2. Machine learning for optimal chunk selection
3. Query-specific truncation strategies
4. Feedback loop for threshold tuning
5. A/B testing different configurations

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, revert by changing:
1. `EMBEDDING_SETTINGS.similarityThreshold` back to 0.7
2. Chunk counts back to original values (10/15/8)
3. Remove content-type-aware truncation logic

All changes are isolated and can be reverted independently.
