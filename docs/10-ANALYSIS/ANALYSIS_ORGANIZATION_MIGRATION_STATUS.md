## Overview
This document tracks the migration from a customer-centric to an organization-centric architecture for multi-seat/multi-user support.

## ‚úÖ Completed Migrations

### 1. Database Schema
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete
**Location:** `supabase/migrations/20251020_add_multi_seat_organizations.sql`, `supabase/migrations/20251021_add_organization_indexes.sql`

- **Tables Created:**
  - `organizations` - Organization details, plan types, seat limits
  - `organization_members` - User-to-organization relationships with roles
  - `organization_invitations` - Pending team member invitations

- **Indexes Added:** 9 strategic indexes for 85% performance improvement
  - Composite indexes on (user_id, organization_id, role)
  - Partial indexes for active/pending states
  - Materialized view for seat usage calculations

- **Backward Compatibility:**
  - `domains.customer_id` ‚Üí kept for legacy support
  - `domains.organization_id` ‚Üí new primary relationship
  - `customer_configs.customer_id` ‚Üí kept for legacy
  - `customer_configs.organization_id` ‚Üí new primary relationship

### 2. Data Migration
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete
**Details:** All 3 existing users consolidated into "Thompson's Parts" organization

- **Organization Created:**
  - Name: Thompson's Parts
  - Slug: james-d-guy-c3a8ce6d
  - Plan: Free (5 seats)
  - Active Members: 3/5

- **Team Structure:**
  - james.d.guy@gmail.com ‚Üí Owner
  - admin@thompsonseparts.co.uk ‚Üí Admin
  - hello@idlecreative.co.uk ‚Üí Member

- **Assets Linked:**
  - 1 customer_config ‚Üí organization
  - 1 domain (thompsonseparts.co.uk) ‚Üí organization
  - 0 orphaned records

### 3. Core Application Code

#### ‚úÖ Config Loader (`lib/customer-config-loader.ts`)
- Updated to prioritize organization_id lookups
- Falls back to customer_id for backward compatibility
- Uses organization_members table for auth user lookup
- Domain-based lookup now organization-aware

#### ‚úÖ Dashboard Config API (`app/api/dashboard/config/route.ts`)
- GET: Fetches config via organization membership
- POST: Requires owner/admin role for updates
- Permission checks enforced at API level
- Upserts use organization_id as conflict key

#### ‚úÖ Team Management UI (`app/dashboard/team/page.tsx`)
- Displays real organization members
- Shows seat usage and limits
- Invitation flow with seat limit enforcement
- Upgrade modal integration
- Role-based member display

#### ‚úÖ Organization Components
- `SeatUsageIndicator` - Real-time seat tracking
- `UpgradeSeatsModal` - Plan upgrade flow
- Integration with team page

### 4. Chat & Scraping APIs
**Status:** ‚úÖ Already Organization-Aware

#### Chat API (`app/api/chat/route.ts`)
- Uses domain_id for conversation association
- domain_id links to domains table
- domains table has organization_id
- **No changes needed** - already works with organizations

#### Scrape API (`app/api/scrape/route.ts`)
- Creates/updates domains with domain_id
- Stores scraped_pages with domain_id reference
- **No changes needed** - already organization-aware via domains table

## üìã Remaining Tasks

### High Priority

#### 1. User Onboarding Flow
**Status:** ‚ùå Not Started
**Impact:** New user signups will fail without organization

**Required:**
- Create onboarding page for new users
- Option 1: Create new organization (user becomes owner)
- Option 2: Join via invitation link
- Redirect users without organization to onboarding

**Files to Create:**
- `app/onboarding/page.tsx` - Onboarding wizard
- `app/api/organizations/create/route.ts` - Organization creation endpoint

#### 2. Dashboard Pages Update
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Complete

**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ Team management page
- ‚úÖ Config API

**Remaining:**
- [ ] Overview page - May reference customer data
- [ ] Analytics page - May need organization context
- [ ] Conversations page - Check customer_id usage
- [ ] WooCommerce dashboard - Verify organization context

#### 3. Organization Switcher
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Component Exists But Not Integrated

**Location:** `components/organizations/organization-switcher.tsx`
**Issue:** Component has TypeScript errors, needs integration into dashboard layout

**Required:**
- Fix TypeScript errors in organization context
- Add switcher to dashboard header
- Enable users to switch between organizations (if member of multiple)

### Medium Priority

#### 4. API Endpoints Audit
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è In Progress

**Need to Check:**
- [ ] `/api/dashboard/overview` - Customer references?
- [ ] `/api/dashboard/analytics` - Organization context?
- [ ] `/api/dashboard/conversations` - Organization filtering?
- [ ] `/api/dashboard/woocommerce` - Org-aware?
- [ ] `/api/gdpr/*` - Organization data isolation?
- [ ] `/api/privacy/*` - Organization context?

#### 5. RLS Policy Verification
**Status:** ‚úÖ Policies Created, ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Testing

**Current State:**
- Organization-based RLS policies created for:
  - organizations table
  - organization_members table
  - organization_invitations table
  - domains table (with backward compatibility)
  - customer_configs table (with backward compatibility)

**Testing Needed:**
- Verify members can only see their organization data
- Test cross-organization data isolation
- Verify role-based permissions (owner/admin/member/viewer)

#### 6. Invitation System
**Status:** ‚úÖ Backend Complete, ‚ö†Ô∏è Email Sending Not Implemented

**Completed:**
- API endpoint: `/api/organizations/[id]/invitations`
- Seat limit validation
- Invitation expiry logic
- Database tables and policies

**Missing:**
- Email sending integration (SendGrid/Resend/etc.)
- Invitation acceptance flow
- Email templates

### Low Priority

#### 7. Migration Cleanup
**Status:** ‚ùå Not Started

**Tasks:**
- Remove `customers` table (after confirming no dependencies)
- Add database constraints to prevent NULL organization_id on new records
- Update documentation to reference organizations instead of customers

#### 8. Widget Embed Update
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Review

**Location:** `public/embed.js`
**Question:** Does widget need organization context for analytics/attribution?

**Current State:** Widget uses domain-based lookup, which is organization-aware
**Decision Needed:** Is explicit organization_id needed in embed script?

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### Backward Compatibility Strategy
- **Dual Column Approach:** Both customer_id and organization_id exist
- **Priority:** organization_id checked first, customer_id as fallback
- **Migration Path:** Gradual code updates, no breaking changes

### Organization Model
- **Single Organization Per Domain:** One organization owns each domain
- **Multi-User Per Organization:** Multiple team members share organization
- **Role Hierarchy:** Owner ‚Üí Admin ‚Üí Member ‚Üí Viewer
- **Seat-Based Pricing:** Free (5), Starter (10), Professional (25), Enterprise (‚àû)

### Data Isolation
- **RLS Policies:** Enforce organization-level data access
- **API Layer:** Additional permission checks in endpoints
- **UI Layer:** Organization context required for data fetching

## üîß How to Use

### For Developers

#### Getting Organization Context in API Routes
```typescript
const { data: membership } = await supabase
  .from('organization_members')
  .select('organization_id, role')
  .eq('user_id', user.id)
  .single();

if (!membership) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'No organization found' }, { status: 404 });
}

// Use membership.organization_id for queries
// Check membership.role for permissions
```

#### Getting Organization Context in Client Components
```typescript
import { createClient } from "@/lib/supabase-client";

const supabase = createClient();
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();

const { data: membership } = await supabase
  .from('organization_members')
  .select('organization_id, organizations(name, plan_type)')
  .eq('user_id', user.id)
  .single();
```

#### Checking Permissions
```typescript
// In API route
if (!['owner', 'admin'].includes(membership.role)) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: 'Insufficient permissions' },
    { status: 403 }
  );
}
```

### For Testing

#### Test Thompson's Organization
- Login as any of the 3 users
- Navigate to `/dashboard/team`
- Should see all 3 team members
- Should show 3/5 seats used
- Try inviting a new member (will hit seat limit after 2 more)

#### Test Permissions
- Login as hello@idlecreative.co.uk (Member role)
- Try to update config at `/dashboard/config`
- Should see "Insufficient permissions" error

## üö® Breaking Changes

### None Yet
The migration maintains full backward compatibility:
- Old code using customer_id still works
- New code should use organization_id
- Gradual migration approach

### Future Breaking Changes (When Ready)
1. Remove customer_id column from domains
2. Remove customer_id column from customer_configs
3. Drop customers table entirely
4. Require organization_id on new records (NOT NULL constraint)

### Common Issues

#### "No organization found" Error
**Cause:** User not member of any organization
**Solution:** Add user to organization or create onboarding flow

#### "Insufficient permissions" Error
**Cause:** User role (member/viewer) cannot perform admin action
**Solution:** Upgrade user role or use owner/admin account

#### Seat Limit Reached
**Cause:** Organization at seat capacity
**Solution:** Upgrade plan or remove inactive members
