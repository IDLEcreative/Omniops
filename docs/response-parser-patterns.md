## Overview

The ResponseParser automatically detects and extracts entities, corrections, and lists from user messages and AI responses to improve conversation context awareness.

## Detection Patterns

### 1. Correction Detection

Detects when users correct their previous statements. All patterns are case-insensitive.

#### Pattern 1: "I meant X not Y"
```regex
/(?:sorry|actually|no|wait)[,\s]+(?:i\s+meant|it'?s|i\s+said)\s+([^\s,]+)\s+(?:not|instead\s+of)\s+([^\s,]+)/i
```

**Matches:**
- "Sorry, I meant ZF4 not ZF5" → original: ZF5, corrected: ZF4
- "Actually I meant blue instead of red" → original: red, corrected: blue
- "Wait, I said large not medium" → original: medium, corrected: large

**Captures:**
- Group 1: Corrected value
- Group 2: Original value

---

#### Pattern 2: "not Y but X"
```regex
/not\s+([^\s,]+)[,\s]*(?:but|it'?s)\s+([^\s,]+)/i
```

**Matches:**
- "not red but blue" → original: red, corrected: blue
- "not medium, it's large" → original: medium, corrected: large

**Captures:**
- Group 1: Original value
- Group 2: Corrected value

---

#### Pattern 3: Arrow Notation
```regex
/([^\s,]+)\s*(?:→|->)\s*([^\s,]+)/
```

**Matches:**
- "red -> blue" → original: red, corrected: blue
- "ZF5 → ZF4" → original: ZF5, corrected: ZF4

**Captures:**
- Group 1: Original value
- Group 2: Corrected value

---

#### Pattern 4: "I said X not Y"
```regex
/i\s+said\s+([^\s,]+)[,\s]+not\s+([^\s,]+)/i
```

**Matches:**
- "I said large, not medium" → original: medium, corrected: large

**Captures:**
- Group 1: Corrected value
- Group 2: Original value

---

#### Pattern 5: "it's X not Y"
```regex
/it'?s\s+([^\s,]+)\s+not\s+([^\s,]+)/i
```

**Matches:**
- "it's premium not basic" → original: basic, corrected: premium

**Captures:**
- Group 1: Corrected value
- Group 2: Original value

---

#### Edge Cases Handled

**Length Validation:**
- Corrections with values >50 characters are ignored
- Both original and corrected values must be non-empty
- Prevents false positives from long sentences

---

### 2. Product Extraction

Extracts product references from markdown-formatted links in AI responses.

#### Pattern: Markdown Links
```regex
/\[([^\]]+)\]\(([^)]+)\)/g
```

**Matches:**
- `[ZF4 Pump](https://example.com/zf4)` → name: "ZF4 Pump", url: "https://example.com/zf4"
- `[Blue Widget](https://store.com/widgets/blue)` → name: "Blue Widget", url: "https://store.com/widgets/blue"

**Captures:**
- Group 1: Product name
- Group 2: Product URL

---

#### Filtering: Generic Link Text

**Rejected link texts (case-insensitive):**
- "click here"
- "view details"
- "learn more"
- "see more"
- "read more"

**Example:**
- `[click here](https://example.com/info)` → NOT extracted (generic text)
- `[Premium Pump](https://example.com/premium)` → Extracted (specific product)

---

#### Filtering: Non-Product URLs

**Rejected URL patterns:**
- `/docs\./i` - Documentation links
- `/help\./i` - Help links
- `/support\./i` - Support links
- `/about/i` - About pages
- `/contact/i` - Contact pages
- `/\.pdf$/i` - PDF files

**Examples:**
- `[Guide](https://docs.example.com/guide)` → NOT extracted
- `[Manual](https://example.com/manual.pdf)` → NOT extracted
- `[Premium Pump](https://shop.example.com/pumps/premium)` → Extracted

---

### 3. Order Extraction

Extracts order references from AI responses.

#### Pattern: Order Numbers
```regex
/order\s*#?([a-zA-Z0-9]+)/gi
```

**Matches:**
- "Your order #12345 is processing" → order: "12345"
- "order 67890 has shipped" → order: "67890"
- "Order ABC123 is ready" → order: "ABC123"

**Captures:**
- Group 1: Order ID (alphanumeric)

---

#### Edge Cases Handled

**Minimum Length:**
- Order IDs must be at least 2 characters
- Prevents false positives from "order 1", "order a"

**Multiple Orders:**
- Extracts all order references in a single response
- Example: "Order #111 shipped, order #222 pending" → 2 entities

---

### 4. List Detection

Detects numbered or bulleted lists in AI responses.

#### Pattern: List Items
```regex
/(?:^|\n)[\s]*(?:[•\-*]|\d+\.)\s*\[([^\]]+)\]\(([^)]+)\)/gm
```

**Matches:**

**Numbered lists:**
```
1. [Option A](https://example.com/a)
2. [Option B](https://example.com/b)
```

**Bulleted lists with dashes:**
```
- [Option A](https://example.com/a)
- [Option B](https://example.com/b)
```

**Bulleted lists with asterisks:**
```
* [Option A](https://example.com/a)
* [Option B](https://example.com/b)
```

**Bulleted lists with bullets:**
```
• [Option A](https://example.com/a)
• [Option B](https://example.com/b)
```

**Captures:**
- Group 1: Item name
- Group 2: Item URL

---

#### List Requirements

**Minimum Items:**
- Lists must have at least 2 items to be detected
- Single items are NOT tracked as lists (but still tracked as product entities)

**Example:**
```
1. [Only Option](https://example.com/only)
```
- List detection: NO (only 1 item)
- Product entity: YES (still tracked as individual product)

---

#### List Item Dual Tracking

**Important:** List items are tracked BOTH as:
1. Individual product entities (for pronoun resolution)
2. Part of a numbered list (for "item 2" references)

**Example:**
```
1. [Pump A](https://example.com/a)
2. [Pump B](https://example.com/b)
```

**Results in:**
- 2 product entities: "Pump A" and "Pump B"
- 1 list with 2 items

**Why?** This allows both:
- "Tell me more about Pump A" (entity reference)
- "Tell me more about item 2" (list reference)

## Integration with ConversationMetadataManager

### parseAndTrackEntities Function

The `parseAndTrackEntities` helper function integrates the parser with the metadata manager:

```typescript
await parseAndTrackEntities(
  aiResponse,      // AI's response text
  userMessage,     // User's message text
  metadataManager  // ConversationMetadataManager instance
);
```

**Process:**
1. Gets current turn number from metadata manager
2. Parses response using `ResponseParser.parseResponse()`
3. Tracks all extracted entities via `metadataManager.trackEntity()`
4. Tracks all corrections via `metadataManager.trackCorrection()`
5. Tracks all lists via `metadataManager.trackList()`

**Error Handling:**
- All parsing errors are caught and logged
- Parsing failures don't crash the application
- Returns gracefully on any error

---

## Entity Types and Aliases

### Product Entities

```typescript
{
  id: "product_1_ZF4_Pump",
  type: "product",
  value: "ZF4 Pump",
  aliases: ["it", "that", "this", "the product"],
  turnNumber: 1,
  metadata: { url: "https://example.com/zf4" }
}
```

### Order Entities

```typescript
{
  id: "order_2_12345",
  type: "order",
  value: "12345",
  aliases: ["it", "that", "the order", "my order"],
  turnNumber: 2
}
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Regex Complexity

All patterns use efficient regex with:
- **Linear time complexity** O(n) for input length
- **Global flag** `/g` for multiple matches
- **Non-greedy matching** to prevent backtracking
- **Bounded capture groups** `[^\s,]+` instead of `.*`

### Memory Usage

- Entities are created on-demand
- No large data structures held in memory
- All processing is streaming (regex exec loop)

### Error Resilience

- Try-catch blocks prevent crashes
- Invalid input returns empty results
- Malformed markdown is skipped gracefully

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions

1. **Category Extraction**
   - Detect category references ("in the pumps category")
   - Track category context for better filtering

2. **Price Extraction**
   - Detect price mentions ("$99.99", "under $100")
   - Track budget constraints

3. **Quantity Extraction**
   - Detect quantity references ("2 pumps", "qty: 5")
   - Track shopping cart context

4. **Date Extraction**
   - Detect date mentions ("by Friday", "next week")
   - Track shipping/delivery expectations

5. **Custom Entity Types**
   - Allow configuration of additional entity patterns
   - Support domain-specific entities

---

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { ResponseParser } from './lib/chat/response-parser';

const result = ResponseParser.parseResponse(
  "Sorry, I meant blue not red",
  "Got it, here's the [Blue Widget](https://example.com/blue)",
  1
);

// result.corrections = [{ original: "red", corrected: "blue" }]
// result.entities = [{ type: "product", value: "Blue Widget", ... }]
// result.lists = []
```

### Integration with Metadata Manager

```typescript
import { parseAndTrackEntities } from './lib/chat/response-parser';
import { ConversationMetadataManager } from './lib/chat/conversation-metadata';

const metadata = new ConversationMetadataManager();

await parseAndTrackEntities(
  "Here are your options:\n1. [Pump A](https://example.com/a)\n2. [Pump B](https://example.com/b)",
  "Show me pumps",
  metadata
);

// Now metadata contains:
// - 2 product entities (Pump A, Pump B)
// - 1 list with 2 items
// - Can resolve "item 2" to Pump B
```

## Maintenance Notes

### Adding New Patterns

1. Add pattern to appropriate detection method
2. Add test cases to `test-response-parser.ts`
3. Verify all tests pass
4. Update this documentation

### Modifying Existing Patterns

1. Understand why pattern exists (check git history)
2. Add test for new case before changing
3. Verify all existing tests still pass
4. Update documentation if behavior changes

### Performance Testing

Run the test suite to verify performance:
```bash
