## 🎯 Performance Budgets

All performance budgets are defined in [.github/performance-budgets.json](../.github/performance-budgets.json).

### Budget Configuration

**API Budgets:**
- Chat endpoint: p95 < 2000ms, throughput > 10 req/s, error rate < 5%
- Search endpoint: p95 < 500ms, throughput > 20 req/s, error rate < 1%
- Scrape endpoint: p95 < 1000ms, throughput > 5 req/s, error rate < 5%

**Queue Budgets:**
- Job processing: throughput > 50 jobs/s, p95 < 2000ms
- Worker scaling: efficiency > 80%, p95 < 3000ms

**Integration Budgets:**
- E2E purchase: p95 < 5000ms, error rate < 1%
- WooCommerce sync: duration < 30s, p95 < 25000ms
- Multi-tenant: isolation score = 100%, max degradation < 10%

## 🚨 Alerting

Performance regressions trigger alerts to:

**GitHub:**
- Workflow fails on critical violations
- PR comments with performance impact
- GitHub Issues (if enabled)

**Email:**
- team@omniops.co.uk (on critical violations)

**Slack:**
- #performance-alerts (when enabled)
- Configure webhook in [performance-budgets.json](../.github/performance-budgets.json)

## 📖 How to Use This Dashboard

### View Latest Results

1. Go to [GitHub Actions → Nightly Performance Testing](https://github.com/jamesljohnson3/Omniops/actions/workflows/performance-nightly.yml)
2. Click on the latest run
3. View the workflow summary for high-level metrics
4. Download artifacts for detailed analysis

### Compare Performance Over Time

1. Download multiple `performance-metrics-{date}.json` files
2. Use a JSON diff tool or script to compare
3. Look for trends in p95/p99 latencies and throughput

### Investigate Budget Violations

1. Check `budget-violations.json` in workflow artifacts
2. Identify which metric exceeded budget
3. Review code changes between the last passing run and current run
4. Profile the affected endpoint/service
5. Either optimize code or update budget (with justification)

### Update Budgets

If performance legitimately changes (e.g., new features add complexity):

1. Edit [.github/performance-budgets.json](../.github/performance-budgets.json)
2. Document why the budget changed in commit message
3. Next nightly run will use new budgets
