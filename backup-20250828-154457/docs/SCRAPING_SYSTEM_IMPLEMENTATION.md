# Scraping System Implementation Documentation

## Overview
This document details the complete implementation of the web scraping system for the AI Customer Service Agent, including the migration from Firecrawl to Crawlee/Playwright and the creation of a fully functional scraping pipeline.

**Date**: August 25, 2025  
**Primary Goal**: Create an "all-knowing" AI agent that understands entire websites, not just products

---

## 1. Initial State & Problems

### Original Issues
- Database migrations weren't run - tables didn't exist in Supabase
- Test scraper extracted products but with messy price formatting
- System was configured for Firecrawl but not using it
- No worker process for background crawling
- TypeScript/JavaScript module incompatibilities

### Requirements Identified
- Store ALL page content, not just products
- Enable semantic search across entire website
- Clean price/SKU extraction for e-commerce data
- Flexible JSONB storage for varied data types
- Background crawling capability for large sites

---

## 2. Database Schema Implementation

### Created Migration File
**File**: `supabase/migrations/000_complete_schema_fixed.sql`

#### Key Tables Created:
```sql
- customers                 # Multi-tenant support
- customer_configs          # Per-domain configurations
- domains                   # Websites being scraped
- scraped_pages            # Raw page content
- website_content          # Structured content
- page_embeddings          # Vector embeddings for pages
- content_embeddings       # Vector embeddings for content chunks
- structured_extractions   # Flexible JSONB for products/FAQs/etc
- ai_optimized_content     # AI-processed content
- content_hashes           # Deduplication tracking
- page_content_references  # Link relationships
- training_data            # AI training data
- conversations            # Chat history
- messages                 # Individual messages
```

#### Key Features:
- pgvector extension for semantic search
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Proper indexes for performance
- JSONB columns for flexible data storage
- Automatic timestamp updates via triggers

### Migration Issues Fixed
- Original migration had table creation order issues
- Fixed by adding CASCADE drops and proper ordering
- Column reference errors resolved

---

## 3. Price Parser Implementation

### Created Utility
**File**: `lib/price-parser.ts`

#### Features:
```typescript
interface ParsedPrice {
  value: number | null;
  formatted: string;
  currency: string;
  regularPrice?: number;
  salePrice?: number;
  onSale: boolean;
  discount?: number;
  vatIncluded?: boolean;
  vatExcluded?: boolean;
  requiresContact?: boolean;
}
```

#### Handles:
- WooCommerce price formats
- VAT inclusive/exclusive prices
- Sale prices with discount calculation
- "Contact for price" scenarios
- Multiple currency symbols
- SKU cleaning (removes prefixes like "SKU:", "sku:")

---

## 4. Enhanced Scraper Implementation

### Test Scraper
**File**: `test-universal-scraper-enhanced.mjs`

#### Improvements:
- Integrated PriceParser for clean data
- Platform detection (WooCommerce, Shopify, etc.)
- Structured data extraction
- Price statistics calculation
- Clean SKU extraction

### E-commerce Extractor
**File**: `lib/ecommerce-extractor.ts`

#### Modified to:
- Use PriceParser for all price fields
- Clean SKUs automatically
- Handle various e-commerce platforms
- Extract breadcrumbs and navigation

---

## 5. Firecrawl Removal

### Files Modified:
- Removed FIRECRAWL_API_KEY from `.env.local`
- Updated test files to reference generic "scraper" instead of Firecrawl
- Removed Firecrawl mocks from test handlers
- Updated legal pages (terms, privacy) to reference Crawlee/Playwright
- Cleaned test setup files (jest.setup.js, jest.setup.node.js)

### Current State:
- No Firecrawl dependencies
- Uses Crawlee with Playwright for all scraping
- Local scraping with no external API costs

---

## 6. Scraper Worker Implementation

### Created Worker Process
**File**: `lib/scraper-worker.js`

#### Key Features:
- Standalone Node.js process (avoids TypeScript issues)
- Self-contained with all extraction logic
- Uses Crawlee's PlaywrightCrawler
- Generates embeddings with OpenAI
- Stores to Supabase with proper error handling
- **UPSERT logic for duplicate prevention**

#### Worker Components:
```javascript
// Main crawling logic
const crawler = new PlaywrightCrawler({
  maxRequestsPerCrawl: 50,
  requestHandlerTimeoutSecs: 30,
  maxConcurrency: turboMode ? 5 : 2,
  // ... request handlers
});

// Content extraction (integrated)
- htmlToText()
- extractWithReadability()
- fallbackExtraction()
- extractMetadata()
- extractImages()
- extractLinks()

// Embedding generation
- splitIntoChunks()
- generateEmbeddings() using OpenAI
```

### Fixed Issues:
1. Changed import path from `__dirname` to `process.cwd()`
2. Fixed `enqueueLinks` parameter from `maxCount` to `limit`
3. Made worker self-contained (no TypeScript imports)
4. Added environment variable validation
5. Implemented UPSERT with `onConflict: 'url'` to prevent duplicates
6. Fixed TurndownService constructor error by replacing with htmlToText

---

## 7. Content Extractor Fixes

### File: `lib/content-extractor.ts`

#### Issues Fixed:
- TurndownService import errors in Next.js environment
- Replaced with simple htmlToText() function
- Maintains content structure without markdown conversion

---

## 8. Scraping API Configuration

### File: `lib/scraper-api.ts`

#### Modifications:
- Disabled memory limit check for testing
- Fixed worker spawn path
- Fixed duplicate variable declarations

---

## 9. Data Storage Implementation

---

## 15. Performance Optimizations

### Implemented:
- Turbo mode for faster crawling (5 concurrent pages)
- Memory-efficient presets for large sites
- Batch embedding generation (20 chunks at once)
- Request deduplication
- Smart enqueuing (limit 10 links per page)

### Limits:
- Max 50 pages per crawl (configurable)
- 30-second timeout per page
- Chunk size: 1000 characters
- Embedding model: text-embedding-3-small (1536 dimensions)

---

## 16. Security Considerations

### Implemented:
- Row Level Security on all tables
- Service role key only for worker processes
- Encrypted credential storage for WooCommerce
- Rate limiting per domain
- Memory usage monitoring (currently disabled for testing)

---

## 17. Duplicate Handling Implementation

### Problem Identified
Initial scraping created duplicate records when pages were scraped multiple times, leading to:
- Multiple scraped_pages entries for same URL
- Duplicate products in structured_extractions
- Redundant embeddings wasting storage

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. UPSERT Logic in Worker
**File Modified**: `lib/scraper-worker.js`
```javascript
const { data: savedPage } = await supabase
  .from('scraped_pages')
  .upsert(pageData, {
    onConflict: 'url',
    ignoreDuplicates: false
  });
```

#### 2. Utility Scripts Created

**Check Duplicates Script**: `scripts/check-duplicates.mjs`
- Analyzes all tables for duplicate data
- Reports duplicate URLs, SKUs, product names
- Provides recommendations for cleanup

**Cleanup Script**: `scripts/cleanup-duplicates.mjs`
- Removes duplicate scraped_pages (keeps most recent)
- Cleans duplicate products by SKU
- Batch deletes duplicate embeddings
- 5-second safety delay before execution

**Check All Tables**: `scripts/check-all-tables.mjs`
- Shows status of all 15 database tables
- Explains why tables are empty
- Provides implementation recommendations

## 18. Database Table Usage Analysis

### Currently Active Tables (5 of 15)
- `domains` - 1 record (Thompson's Eparts)
- `scraped_pages` - 12 pages stored
- `page_embeddings` - 173 vector chunks
- `structured_extractions` - 33 products
- `website_content` - 3 test records (redundant)

### Empty Tables for Future Features (10 of 15)
- `customers` / `customer_configs` - Multi-tenancy not implemented
- `conversations` / `messages` - Chat not tested yet
- `training_data` - Custom AI training feature
- `ai_optimized_content` - Content optimization feature
- `content_hashes` - Deduplication tracking
- `page_content_references` - Link analysis
- `content_refresh_jobs` - Automatic updates
- `content_embeddings` - Alternative embedding strategy

### Why Tables Are Empty
These tables represent planned features in the architecture but are not yet implemented. They remain in the schema for future development without requiring migrations.

---

## 19. Known Issues & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations:
- Worker process needs better error recovery
- No incremental crawling (always full crawl)
- Manual embedding generation (could be automatic)
- Limited to 50 pages per crawl

### Suggested Improvements:
1. Implement incremental crawling
2. Add scheduling for automatic updates
3. Implement content change detection
4. Add more e-commerce platform support
5. Create admin UI for crawl management

---

## Conclusion

The system has been successfully transformed from a Firecrawl-dependent architecture to a fully self-contained Crawlee/Playwright-based solution. The AI agent now has access to comprehensive website data through:

1. **Raw page content** for context
2. **Vector embeddings** for semantic search
3. **Structured product data** with clean prices
4. **Navigation and relationships** between pages

This enables the AI to be truly "all-knowing" about the websites it serves, providing accurate, contextual responses to customer queries.
