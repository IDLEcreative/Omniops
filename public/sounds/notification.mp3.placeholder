# Notification Sound Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for the notification sound.

To add a notification sound:
1. Replace this file with an actual MP3 file named `notification.mp3`
2. Recommended: Short, pleasant notification sound (~1 second duration)
3. Keep file size under 50KB for fast loading
4. Test across different browsers for compatibility

Free notification sounds can be found at:
- https://notificationsounds.com/
- https://freesound.org/
- https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/notification/

Current setup will gracefully fail if sound file is missing (no errors, just no sound).
