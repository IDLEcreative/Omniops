## Implementation Details

### Tests Implemented

#### Test 8: Out-of-bounds List References ✅ PASSING
**Status**: PASSED
**Purpose**: Validate AI doesn't hallucinate when user asks about items outside the shown list

**Test Flow**:
1. Request "top 3 products"
2. Ask about "item 5" (out of bounds)
3. Verify AI explains limitation instead of hallucinating

**Result**: ✅ AI correctly handled out-of-bounds reference
**Conversation ID**: `39da2b26-6f24-4a66-8b46-7e8825965d10`

---

#### Test 9: Context Accumulation (CRITICAL - 86% Accuracy Validation) ❌ FAILING
**Status**: FAILED (60% accuracy, target: 86%)
**Purpose**: Validate the 86% conversation accuracy claim across 5+ turns

**Test Flow**:
1. Turn 1: "What types of products do you have?" ✅ PASSED
2. Turn 2: "Show me the first type you mentioned" ❌ FAILED
3. Turn 3: "What are the prices?" ✅ PASSED
4. Turn 4: "Are they in stock?" ✅ PASSED
5. Turn 5: "Can I get more details about the first one?" ❌ FAILED

**Result**: ❌ Only 60% accuracy (3/5 turns successful)
**Conversation ID**: `b0a0fbef-3153-4ddf-95ee-fe244bfc66de`

**Analysis**:
- Turn 1 SUCCESS: AI provided product categories as expected
- Turn 2 FAILURE: AI failed to resolve "the first type you mentioned" - likely due to:
  - No numbered list in Turn 1 response
  - Ambiguous reference to "first type"
  - Metadata didn't track category mentions explicitly
- Turn 3 SUCCESS: Price query worked (likely had product context from Turn 2)
- Turn 4 SUCCESS: Pronoun resolution "they" worked correctly
- Turn 5 FAILURE: Complex reference "the first one" failed - possibly:
  - List context lost after 3 turns
  - Reference ambiguity
  - Metadata window limitation

**Root Cause**:
The conversation flow tested a more complex scenario than the typical product list → item reference pattern. The AI struggled with:
1. Resolving references to categories mentioned in prose (not numbered lists)
2. Maintaining list context across multiple turns
3. Complex pronoun chains combined with ordinal references

---

#### Test 10: Context Switching ✅ PASSING
**Status**: PASSED
**Purpose**: Validate AI can switch between topics and return to original context

**Test Flow**:
1. Ask about products
2. Ask about pricing
3. Switch to order tracking
4. Return to products

**Result**: ✅ Successfully switched context and returned
**Conversation ID**: `02d81370-e08b-49a4-82a9-a30563681ef9`

---

#### Test 11: Intent Tracking ✅ PASSING
**Status**: PASSED
**Purpose**: Validate metadata tracks intent changes (product search → order lookup)

**Test Flow**:
1. Start with product search intent ("find a hydraulic pump")
2. Switch to order lookup intent ("track my order #12345")
3. Verify both intents tracked in metadata

**Result**: ✅ Tracked both product and order intents
**Conversation ID**: `89ad13a2-c88c-479f-9979-d5edb5a51aa1`

---

#### Test 12: Metadata Persistence ✅ PASSING
**Status**: PASSED
**Purpose**: Validate metadata saved after EACH turn (cumulative, not replaced)

**Test Flow**:
1. Turn 1: Send message, verify `currentTurn = 1`
2. Turn 2: Send message, verify `currentTurn = 2` and Turn 1 data preserved
3. Turn 3: Send message, verify `currentTurn = 3` and all prior data preserved

**Result**: ✅ Metadata persisted correctly across all turns
**Conversation ID**: `f9812e62-de17-4617-8990-a962fec18986`

**Database Verification**:
- All turns incremented correctly (1 → 2 → 3)
- Metadata is cumulative (earlier turns preserved)
- JSONB updates work as expected

---

#### Test 13: Metadata Updates on Context Changes ✅ PASSING
**Status**: PASSED
**Purpose**: Validate metadata tracks user corrections and updates context

**Test Flow**:
1. Turn 1: "Show me ZF5 pumps"
2. Turn 2: "Sorry, I meant ZF4 not ZF5" (correction)
3. Turn 3: "What are the prices for those?"
4. Verify correction tracked and AI uses ZF4 (not ZF5)

**Result**: ✅ Correction detected and metadata updated
**Conversation ID**: `e653d95a-9d54-4928-bb09-fd8db9a1a19f`

**Metadata Structure Verified**:
```json
{
  "corrections": [
    {
      "originalValue": "ZF5",
      "correctedValue": "ZF4",
      "turnNumber": 2,
      "context": "User corrected part number"
    }
  ],
  "currentTurn": 3
}
```

## Test Infrastructure

### Files Created

1. **`__tests__/integration/multi-turn-conversation-e2e.test.ts`** (656 lines)
   - Jest test suite with 6 implemented tests
   - Helper functions for API calls and metadata retrieval
   - Proper cleanup and tracking

2. **`test-multi-turn-e2e.ts`** (635 lines)
   - Standalone E2E test runner for REAL API calls
   - Bypasses Jest mocks to test actual system
   - Comprehensive reporting with turn-by-turn analysis

3. **`check-test-domain.ts`** (23 lines)
   - Helper script to verify test domain exists
   - Diagnostic tool for test setup

### Key Implementation Patterns

**Helper Function - sendMessage()**:
```typescript
async function sendMessage(message: string, conversationId?: string) {
  const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/chat`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      message,
      domain: TEST_DOMAIN,
      conversation_id: conversationId,
      session_id: `test_e2e_${Date.now()}_${Math.random()}`
    })
  });

  const data = await response.json();
  const metadata = await fetchMetadataFromDB(data.conversation_id);

  return { response: data.message, conversationId: data.conversation_id, metadata };
}
```

**Database Metadata Retrieval**:
```typescript
async function fetchMetadataFromDB(conversationId: string) {
  const supabase = await createServiceRoleClient();
  const { data } = await supabase
    .from('conversations')
    .select('metadata')
    .eq('id', conversationId)
    .single();

  return data?.metadata || {};
}
```

## Critical Findings

### ✅ Successes

1. **Metadata System Works**: All 6 tests confirm metadata tracking is functional
   - Entities tracked correctly
   - Corrections detected and stored
   - Turn counter increments properly
   - Cumulative storage (not replacement)
   - Database persistence verified

2. **Context Switching**: AI successfully switches between topics and returns

3. **Intent Tracking**: System tracks multiple intents in single conversation

4. **Out-of-Bounds Handling**: AI doesn't hallucinate unavailable items

5. **Correction Tracking**: User corrections detected and metadata updated

### ⚠️ Issues Identified

1. **60% Conversation Accuracy** (Target: 86%)
   - Only achieved 60% in the CRITICAL 5-turn test
   - Failures occurred at:
     - Turn 2: "Show me the first type you mentioned" (ambiguous category reference)
     - Turn 5: "the first one" (complex list reference after context switching)

2. **Root Causes**:
   - **List Context Limitation**: AI loses numbered list context after 2-3 turns
   - **Ambiguous References**: AI struggles with non-explicit references ("first type" vs. "item 1")
   - **Pronoun Chains**: Complex pronoun + list combinations fail
   - **Category Tracking**: Categories mentioned in prose aren't tracked as list items

3. **Metadata vs. AI Disconnect**:
   - Metadata IS being tracked correctly
   - Enhanced context IS being injected into system prompt
   - BUT: AI isn't consistently using the metadata to resolve references

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)

1. **Investigate Turn 2 Failure**:
   ```bash
   # Analyze the actual AI response from Turn 2
   SELECT metadata FROM conversations WHERE id = 'b0a0fbef-3153-4ddf-95ee-fe244bfc66de';
   ```

2. **Review System Prompt**:
   - Check if metadata context is clear enough for AI
   - Consider more explicit instructions for list references
   - Add examples of pronoun resolution to prompt

3. **Test with Simpler Conversation Flow**:
   - Use explicit numbered lists from Turn 1
   - Avoid ambiguous category references
   - Test ordinal references immediately after list creation

### Medium-Term Improvements (Week 2-3)

1. **Enhanced List Tracking**:
   - Track categories as implicit lists
   - Detect when AI mentions multiple items in prose
   - Create list metadata even without numbered format

2. **Reference Resolution Hints**:
   - Add system prompt instructions for "first type" → category mapping
   - Provide explicit examples in enhanced context
   - Use few-shot prompting for complex references

3. **Metadata Window Tuning**:
   - Current: 3-turn lookback for recency
   - Test: Increase to 5-turn window for list persistence
   - Measure: Impact on accuracy vs. prompt size

### Long-Term Strategy (Month 1+)

1. **Accuracy Improvement Plan**:
   - Target: 86%+ accuracy on multi-turn tests
   - Method: Iterative prompt engineering + metadata enhancements
   - Validation: Re-run Test 9 weekly to track progress

2. **Additional Test Scenarios**:
   - Test with real Thompson's Parts conversations
   - Capture common user patterns from production
   - Build test suite from actual failure cases

3. **Monitoring in Production**:
   - Track conversation accuracy metrics
   - Alert if accuracy drops below 75%
   - A/B test prompt variations
