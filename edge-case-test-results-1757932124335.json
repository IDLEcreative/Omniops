I’m afraid those specs (0 mm thickness, negative weight, free price, and solid gold material) aren’t physically possible, so we can’t supply an item that meets all of them.\n\nHere are some helpful next steps I can take for you:\n• I can check our current selection for premium or gold‑plated brake pads and suggest options that come closest to your aesthetic needs \n• I can connect you with our customer service team to discuss custom or special‑order possibilities (they’ll confirm feasibility and pricing) \n• Consider alternative materials or finishes we carry that give a gold look without using solid gold \n• If you’d like, tell me the vehicle or equipment these are for and any must‑have requirements, and I’ll recommend matching products from our catalog\n\nWhich option would you like me to do next?",
