## 🚀 Next Steps (Your Action Required)

### Step 1: Get Stripe API Keys (5 minutes)
1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/register
2. Create a Stripe account (or login if you have one)
3. Navigate to: Developers → API keys
4. Copy your **Test mode** keys:
   - Secret key (starts with `sk_test_`)
   - Publishable key (starts with `pk_test_`)

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables (2 minutes)
Open `.env.local` and replace these placeholders:
```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HERE
```

### Step 3: Create Stripe Products (5 minutes)
```bash
./scripts/stripe/create-products.sh
```
This will:
- Create Starter product (£29/month)
- Create Professional product (£99/month)
- Create Enterprise product (custom)
- Display price IDs to add to `.env.local`

**Copy the price IDs** and update `.env.local`:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_STARTER_PRICE_ID=price_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PROFESSIONAL_PRICE_ID=price_...
```

### Step 4: Set Up Webhook Forwarding (2 minutes)
In a **separate terminal window**, run:
```bash
./scripts/stripe/setup-webhook.sh
```
This will:
- Start forwarding webhooks to your local dev server
- Display a webhook signing secret

**Copy the webhook secret** and update `.env.local`:
```bash
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

**Important**: Keep this terminal window open while developing!

### Step 5: Restart Dev Server (1 minute)
After updating `.env.local`, restart your development server:
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop the current server
npm run dev
```

### Step 6: Test the Integration (15 minutes)
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/billing
2. Click "Select Plan" on Starter
3. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
4. Complete checkout
5. Verify subscription appears with "Active" status
6. Check webhook terminal for `checkout.session.completed` event

**Run automated tests**:
```bash
./scripts/stripe/test-integration.sh
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Stripe CLI not found"
```bash
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
stripe login
```

### Issue: "Webhook signature verification failed"
- Verify `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env.local`
- Ensure `setup-webhook.sh` is running
- Restart dev server after adding secret

### Issue: "Price IDs not working"
- Verify you copied the correct price IDs from `create-products.sh` output
- Check for typos in `.env.local`
- Ensure you're using test mode price IDs (start with `price_`)

### Issue: "Database errors"
- Verify migrations were applied (they were during setup ✅)
- Check Supabase connection in `.env.local`
- Verify service role key has proper permissions

### Issue: "TypeScript errors"
- Already fixed during setup ✅
- If new errors appear, run: `npm install`

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Test Mode vs Live Mode
- You're currently set up for **TEST MODE**
- Use test cards for all transactions
- No real money will be charged
- Switch to live mode for production (see deployment checklist)

### Webhook Forwarding
- Only works while `setup-webhook.sh` is running
- If webhooks stop, check if the script is still running
- Restart if needed

### Environment Variables
- Changes to `.env.local` require server restart
- Don't commit `.env.local` to git (already in `.gitignore`)
- Keep your secret keys secure
