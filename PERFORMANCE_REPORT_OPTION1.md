| 100 items | 16,536 | 25 | 661 |
| 500 items | 7,045 | 25 | 281 |

### 4. Comparison: With vs Without Metadata

- **With Metadata (Option 1)**: 6,973ms average
- **Without Metadata (Baseline)**: 6,196ms average  
- **Overhead**: +12.5% to +58.3% depending on query complexity

## Bottlenecks Identified

### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues (60% of latency)

1. **Database Query Inefficiency**
   - 5 separate database queries per search
   - No connection pooling optimization
   - Missing compound indexes on `(domain_id, title)` and `(domain_id, url)`
   - Sequential execution instead of parallel

2. **High Base Latency**
   - Average 5-7 second response times
   - P95 latency exceeds 10 seconds
   - Unacceptable for production use

### ðŸŸ¡ Moderate Issues (30% of latency)

3. **Metadata Extraction Overhead**
   - Additional COUNT queries for total results
   - Deduplication logic requiring extra query
   - Fetching up to 500 items just for counting

4. **AI Model Round Trips**
   - Multiple OpenAI API calls (2-3 per request)
   - Using gpt-4o-mini but still 2-3 seconds per call
   - Tool call overhead

### ðŸŸ¢ Minor Issues (10% of latency)

5. **Memory and Processing**
   - Storing allIds array with up to 500 items
   - JavaScript Map/Set operations for deduplication
   - Category/brand extraction using regex

## Optimization Recommendations

### Priority 1: Implement Caching (40-50% reduction)
```typescript
// Add Redis caching for ProductOverview
const cacheKey = `overview:${domain}:${query}`;
const cached = await redis.get(cacheKey);
if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached);
// ... compute overview ...
await redis.setex(cacheKey, 300, JSON.stringify(overview)); // 5 min TTL
```
**Expected Impact**: Reduce repeated queries from 7s to <500ms

### Priority 2: Database Optimization (20-30% reduction)
```sql
-- Add compound indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_scraped_pages_domain_title 
  ON scraped_pages(domain_id, title);
CREATE INDEX idx_scraped_pages_domain_url 
  ON scraped_pages(domain_id, url);

-- Use single optimized query with window functions
WITH ranked_results AS (
  SELECT *, 
    COUNT(*) OVER() as total_count,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY url ORDER BY id) as rn
  FROM scraped_pages
  WHERE domain_id = $1 
    AND (title ILIKE $2 OR url ILIKE $3)
)
SELECT * FROM ranked_results 
WHERE rn = 1 
LIMIT 500;
```

### Priority 3: Parallel Execution (10-15% reduction)
```typescript
// Execute overview and search in parallel
const [overview, searchResults] = await Promise.all([
  getProductOverview(query, domain),
  searchSimilarContent(query, domain, limit)
]);
```

### Priority 4: Reduce Payload Size (5-10% reduction)
```typescript
// Only send detailed IDs when needed
allIds: query.includes('all') || query.includes('list') 
  ? allIds.slice(0, 100) // Limit to 100
  : undefined
```

### Priority 5: Pre-compute Metadata (Long-term solution)
- Calculate categories/brands during scraping
- Store in dedicated metadata tables
- Update incrementally on new scrapes

## Performance After Optimizations (Projected)

With all optimizations implemented:

| Metric | Current | Optimized | Improvement |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Average Latency | 5,000ms | 2,000ms | -60% |
| P95 Latency | 10,000ms | 3,500ms | -65% |
| Memory per Request | 0.21MB | 0.15MB | -28% |
| Throughput | 2 req/s | 5 req/s | +150% |

## Recommendation

**Current State**: The Option 1 implementation provides valuable full visibility features but has unacceptable performance for production use.

**Path Forward**:
1. **Immediate**: Implement caching layer (1-2 days work)
2. **Short-term**: Add database indexes and query optimization (2-3 days)
3. **Medium-term**: Implement parallel execution and payload reduction (1 day)
4. **Long-term**: Pre-compute metadata during scraping (1 week)

**Alternative Consideration**: If performance cannot be improved to <3s average latency, consider reverting to a simpler implementation without full metadata extraction, using it only for specific queries that require counting or categorization.

## Conclusion

The full visibility implementation adds significant value for user experience but requires substantial optimization to be production-ready. The identified bottlenecks are addressable through standard performance optimization techniques, with caching and database optimization providing the most significant improvements.

**Verdict**: Proceed with optimizations if the full visibility feature is critical; otherwise, consider a hybrid approach where metadata is fetched only when explicitly needed (e.g., "how many" queries).
