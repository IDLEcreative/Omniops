## Current System Performance Analysis

### ‚úÖ Working Components

1. **API Structure**: 
   - Proper endpoint structure at `/api/chat-intelligent`
   - Returns comprehensive metadata including:
     - `searchMetadata`: Iteration count, search operations, result breakdown
     - `tokenUsage`: Input/output tokens, cost tracking
     - `conversation_id`: Session management
     - `sources`: Search result provenance

2. **AI Integration**:
   - GPT-5-mini model integration with reasoning capabilities
   - Tool-calling system with multiple search functions:
     - `woocommerce_agent`: E-commerce operations
     - `search_products`: Semantic product search
     - `search_by_category`: Category-based queries
     - `get_product_details`: Detailed product information
     - `order_lookup`: Order verification system

3. **Search Intelligence**:
   - Multi-iteration ReAct loop (up to 5 iterations)
   - Parallel tool execution for faster results
   - Adaptive search strategies based on query type
   - Anti-hallucination measures to prevent false product claims

### ‚ùå Critical Performance Issues

1. **Database Statement Timeouts**:
   ```
   [RAG Metadata] Query error: {
     code: '57014',
     message: 'canceling statement due to statement timeout'
   }
   ```
   - Vector similarity searches frequently timeout
   - Embeddings queries exceed database timeout limits
   - Search operations fail before completion

2. **Search Coverage Gaps**:
   - **Observed**: 2-42 products found for major categories
   - **Expected**: 200+ products for comprehensive searches
   - **Impact**: AI receives incomplete context

3. **WooCommerce Integration Issues**:
   ```
   [WooCommerce Agent] Error: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')
   Order verification error: Request failed with status code 401
   ```

4. **Performance Degradation**:
   - Average response time: 20-30 seconds
   - Frequent timeouts on product searches
   - Search operations timing out at 60 seconds

## Search Coverage Verification Results

### From Available Logs Analysis

**Successful Searches Observed**:
- ‚úÖ "Cifa" query: 42 results found (cached)
- ‚úÖ "hydraulic pump" query: 43 results found (cached)
- ‚úÖ "DC66-10P Agri Flip": 1 result found (direct SKU match)
- ‚úÖ "pumps" query: 40 results found before timeout

**Search Method Analysis**:
- **Semantic Search**: Primary method using embeddings
- **WooCommerce Integration**: Available but has authentication issues
- **Keyword Fallback**: Used when semantic search fails
- **Product URL Enhancement**: Combines multiple content chunks for complete product info

### AI Context Handling

**Token Usage Patterns**:
```
Input: 2,000-5,000 tokens per query
Output: 300-600 tokens per response
Total Cost: $0.001-0.003 per query
```

**Context Management**:
- ‚úÖ AI receives search result summaries with product counts
- ‚úÖ Tool responses include pricing, SKUs, and specifications
- ‚úÖ Response formatting is user-friendly and organized
- ‚ùå Context may be incomplete due to search timeouts

## Database Performance Issues

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Vector Similarity Search Bottlenecks**:
   - Embeddings table queries exceed timeout limits
   - Complex similarity calculations on large datasets
   - Missing database performance optimizations

2. **Product Enhancement Process**:
   ```
   [RAG] Processing product URL: https://...
   [RAG] Found 21 chunks for product
   [RAG] Enhanced product content: 5966 chars
   ```
   - System fetches ALL chunks for product URLs
   - Multiple database queries per product
   - No query result caching implemented

3. **Connection Pool Issues**:
   - Supabase connection limits may be exceeded
   - Long-running queries block other operations

## Recommendations for Search Coverage Improvement

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Database Query Optimization**:
   ```sql
   -- Add missing indexes for embeddings queries
   CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_page_embeddings_domain_similarity 
   ON page_embeddings (domain_id, similarity DESC);
   
   -- Optimize vector search queries with limits
   SELECT * FROM page_embeddings 
   WHERE domain_id = $1 
   ORDER BY embedding <-> $2 
   LIMIT 100; -- Add reasonable limits
   ```

2. **Implement Search Result Caching**:
   - Cache common queries (Cifa, pumps, brands)
   - 15-minute cache TTL for product searches
