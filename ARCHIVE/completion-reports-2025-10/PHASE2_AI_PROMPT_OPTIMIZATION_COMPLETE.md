✅ **Completed:** Enhanced [lib/chat/woocommerce-types/tool-definition.ts](lib/chat/woocommerce-types/tool-definition.ts#L11-L18)

**Enhancements Made:**

**Before:**
```typescript
description: "Handle WooCommerce operations like checking detailed stock, getting product info, checking order status, and other commerce-specific tasks"
```

**After:**
```typescript
description: "Access live WooCommerce store data for real-time commerce operations. Use for: (1) Product info: exact stock levels, pricing, variations, reviews; (2) Orders: status lookup, tracking, history, cancellations, refunds; (3) Cart: add/remove items, quantity updates, coupon application; (4) Store config: shipping methods, payment gateways; (5) Business intelligence: low stock alerts, sales reports, customer insights. Supports 25 operations covering the complete e-commerce lifecycle. Use search_products for product discovery, then get_product_details for specifics, then check_stock before recommending."
```

**Operation Parameter Description Enhanced:**
- Added intent-based operation mapping
- Included examples: "search_products (finding products), get_product_details (specific info), check_stock (availability)"
- Clarified decision criteria for operation selection

---

## 📊 Key Improvements

### 1. Workflow Clarity
**Before:** Operations listed as flat reference
**After:** Operations organized into proven workflows with step-by-step guidance

**Impact:** AI now understands that customer interactions follow patterns, not isolated operations

---

### 2. Decision Criteria
**Before:** Generic descriptions like "Handle WooCommerce operations"
**After:** Specific use cases and intent mapping

**Example:**
- "Exactly how many do you have?" → `get_stock_quantity`
- "Is this in stock?" → `check_stock`
- "Tell me more about A4VTG90" → `get_product_details`

**Impact:** AI can now match customer language to specific operations

---

### 3. Multi-Step Guidance
**Before:** No guidance on operation sequences
**After:** Clear workflows showing operation dependencies

**Example:** Product Discovery
```
1. search_products (find candidates)
   ↓

## 🎓 Technical Approach

### Challenge: OpenAI Function Calling Limitations
OpenAI's function calling format doesn't support individual descriptions for enum values. You can't do:
```typescript
enum: [
  {value: "check_stock", description: "Check if product is available"},  // ❌ Not supported
  {value: "get_stock_quantity", description: "Get exact inventory count"}
]
```

### Solution: Dual-Level Enhancement
1. **Tool-Level Description** (line 11)
   - Comprehensive overview of ALL capabilities
   - Organized into 5 categories
   - Includes recommended workflow

2. **Parameter-Level Description** (line 18)
   - Maps customer intents to specific operations
   - Provides decision criteria
   - Includes usage examples

**Result:** AI receives guidance at both the tool selection level and the operation selection level.

## 📈 Expected Impact

### Improved Tool Selection Accuracy
**Before:** AI might use wrong operation or skip necessary steps
**After:** AI follows proven workflows and selects appropriate operations

### Better Multi-Step Processes
**Before:** AI might stop after first operation
**After:** AI completes full workflows (search → details → stock → cart)

### Clearer Decision Making
**Before:** Ambiguity between similar operations
**After:** Clear criteria for choosing between `check_stock`, `get_stock_quantity`, `get_product_details`

---

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

To validate Phase 2 improvements, test these scenarios:

### Test 1: Product Discovery Workflow
```
User: "Do you have hydraulic pumps?"
Expected: AI uses search_products, then offers to get details on specific pumps
```

### Test 2: Stock Inquiry Differentiation
```
User: "Is the A4VTG90 in stock?"
Expected: AI uses check_stock (availability status)

User: "Exactly how many A4VTG90 do you have?"
Expected: AI uses get_stock_quantity (precise number)
```

### Test 3: Order Management Flow
```
User: "Where's my order #12345?"
Expected: AI uses check_order, then potentially get_shipping_info for tracking
```

### Test 4: Cart Workflow
```
User: "I want to buy 2 A4VTG90 pumps"
Expected: AI follows: search_products → get_product_details → check_stock → add_to_cart
```

## 💡 Key Learnings

### 1. Workflows > Operations
Teaching the AI individual operations is insufficient. It needs to understand:
- **Sequences**: Which operations typically follow each other
- **Dependencies**: What information from operation A is needed for operation B
- **Decision Points**: When to branch (order number vs email lookup)

### 2. Intent Mapping is Critical
The AI must understand that:
- "Is it in stock?" → `check_stock` (boolean)
- "How many do you have?" → `get_stock_quantity` (number)
- "Tell me about it" → `get_product_details` (full info)

Without this mapping, the AI might use the wrong operation for the user's actual intent.

### 3. Examples Drive Understanding
Every workflow and operation now includes:
- **Example customer queries** - The exact language users might use
- **Expected outputs** - What the operation returns
- **Usage context** - When to use this vs alternatives

### 4. Tool Descriptions Matter
Even though OpenAI's function calling format is limiting, the descriptions at both the tool level and parameter level significantly influence AI decision-making.
