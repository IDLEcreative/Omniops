## 🎓 Key Implementation Details

### 1. Non-Invasive Analytics Tracking

**Pattern:** Wrapper function that never breaks operations

```typescript
export async function executeWooCommerceOperation(
  operation: string,
  params: WooCommerceOperationParams,
  domain: string
): Promise<WooCommerceOperationResult> {
  const start = Date.now();

  try {
    // Get config ID for analytics
    const { data: config } = await supabase
      .from('customer_configs')
      .select('id')
      .eq('domain', domain)
      .single();

    // Execute operation
    const result = await /* ... operation logic ... */;

    // Track success metrics
    await trackOperationMetrics({
      operation,
      duration_ms: Date.now() - start,
      success: result.success,
      domain,
      customer_config_id: config?.id
    });

    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    // Track error metrics
    await trackOperationMetrics({
      operation,
      duration_ms: Date.now() - start,
      success: false,
      error_type: error.constructor.name,
      error_message: error.message,
      domain,
      customer_config_id: config?.id
    });

    throw error;
  }
}

// Helper function with silent fail
async function trackOperationMetrics(metrics) {
  try {
    await supabase
      .from('woocommerce_usage_metrics')
      .insert(metrics);
  } catch (error) {
    // Silent fail - never break operations
    console.error('[Analytics] Failed to track metrics:', error);
  }
}
```

**Why This Works:**
- Tracking happens after operation execution (no performance impact)
- Silent fail ensures metrics never break operations
- Captures both success and error metrics
- Includes customer context for multi-tenant analytics

---

### 2. Efficient Database Schema

**Composite Index for Dashboard Queries:**

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_woocommerce_metrics_dashboard ON woocommerce_usage_metrics(
  domain, created_at DESC, operation
);
```

**Why:** Dashboard queries filter by domain, sort by date, and group by operation - this single index serves all three needs efficiently.

**RLS for Security:**

```sql
-- Users can only see metrics for their own domains
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own domain metrics"
  ON woocommerce_usage_metrics
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    domain IN (
      SELECT domain FROM customer_configs
      WHERE customer_configs.id = (
        SELECT customer_config_id FROM user_profiles
        WHERE user_profiles.id = auth.uid()
      )
    )
  );
```

---

### 3. Health Check Design

**Multi-Domain Parallel Testing:**

```typescript
const healthChecks = await Promise.all(
  configs.map(async (config) => {
    const startTime = Date.now();
    try {
      const wc = await getDynamicWooCommerceClient(config.domain);
      await wc.get('system_status'); // Actual API call
      return {
        domain: config.domain,
        status: 'healthy',
        response_time_ms: Date.now() - startTime
      };
    } catch (error) {
      return {
        domain: config.domain,
        status: 'error',
        message: error.message,
        response_time_ms: Date.now() - startTime
      };
    }
  })
);

// Calculate overall status
const overallStatus = healthyCount === totalCount ? 'healthy' :
                      healthyCount === 0 ? 'critical' : 'degraded';
```

**Benefits:**
- Parallel execution (fast for multiple domains)
- Tests actual connectivity (not just config presence)
- Granular per-domain status
- Overall system health categorization

## 📈 Analytics Capabilities

### Available Metrics

The analytics system tracks:

1. **Total Operations** - Count of all operation executions
2. **Success Rate** - Percentage of successful operations
3. **Average Duration** - Mean response time in milliseconds
4. **Operations by Type** - Breakdown of which operations are used most
5. **Errors by Type** - Common error patterns (AxiosError, ZodError, etc.)

### Query Examples

```bash
# Get last 7 days of analytics
GET /api/woocommerce/analytics?days=7

# Filter by specific domain
GET /api/woocommerce/analytics?domain=example.com&days=30

# Filter by specific operation
GET /api/woocommerce/analytics?operation=search_products&days=14

# Limit results
GET /api/woocommerce/analytics?limit=50
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "metrics": [/* raw metrics array */],
    "stats": {
      "total_operations": 1250,
      "success_rate": 98.4,
      "avg_duration_ms": 1825,
      "operations_by_type": {
        "search_products": 450,
        "get_product_details": 320,
        "check_stock": 280,
        "check_order": 150,
        "add_to_cart": 50
      },
      "errors_by_type": {
        "AxiosError": 15,
        "ValidationError": 5
      }
    },
    "filters": {
      "days": 7,
      "limit": 100
    }
  }
}
```

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### 1. Silent Fail Pattern for Non-Critical Features
Analytics tracking uses a silent fail pattern to ensure it never breaks core operations. This pattern is essential for non-critical features:

```typescript
try {
  // Track metrics
} catch (error) {
  console.error('[Analytics] Failed:', error);
  // Don't throw - continue operation
}
```

### 2. Composite Indexes for Dashboard Queries
The single composite index `(domain, created_at DESC, operation)` serves all dashboard query patterns efficiently, avoiding the need for 3+ separate indexes.

### 3. Parallel Health Checks
Using `Promise.all()` for health checks across multiple domains provides fast results and catches issues that might only affect specific configurations.

### 4. Validation Before Proceeding
Creating comprehensive tests for Phase 2 before proceeding to Phase 3 ensured all prompt enhancements were correctly integrated before building on top of them.
