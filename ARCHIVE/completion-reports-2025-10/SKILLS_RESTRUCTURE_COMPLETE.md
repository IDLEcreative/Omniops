# Skills Restructure Complete

**Date:** 2025-11-01
**Type:** Framework Restructuring
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Time Taken:** 20 minutes

## Executive Summary

Successfully restructured all 5 skills to follow proper skill-creator format with YAML frontmatter, directory-based organization, and bundled validation scripts. Skills are now properly discoverable and distributable.

---

## What Was Restructured

### Before (Incorrect Format):
```
.claude/skills/
├── refactoring-specialist.md          ❌ Wrong filename
├── file-placement-enforcer.md         ❌ Wrong filename
├── docs-standards-validator.md        ❌ Wrong filename
├── optimization-reviewer.md           ❌ Wrong filename
└── brand-agnostic-checker.md          ❌ Wrong filename
```

**Issues:**
- No YAML frontmatter (name/description missing)
- Wrong filename (should be SKILL.md)
- No directory structure
- Scripts in central location, not bundled

### After (Correct Format):
```
.claude/skills/
├── refactoring-specialist/
│   ├── SKILL.md                       ✅ Proper naming
│   └── scripts/
│       ├── validate-refactoring.sh
│       ├── analyze-file-complexity.sh
│       ├── validate-file-placement.sh
│       └── suggest-file-location.sh
├── file-placement-enforcer/
│   ├── SKILL.md
│   └── scripts/
│       ├── validate-file-placement.sh
│       └── suggest-file-location.sh
├── docs-standards-validator/
│   ├── SKILL.md
│   └── scripts/
│       └── validate-documentation.sh
├── optimization-reviewer/
│   ├── SKILL.md
│   └── scripts/
│       ├── analyze-query-performance.sh
│       └── check-bundle-impact.sh
└── brand-agnostic-checker/
    ├── SKILL.md
    └── scripts/
        └── check-brand-agnostic.sh
```

**Fixed:**
- ✅ YAML frontmatter with name and description
- ✅ Proper SKILL.md naming
- ✅ Directory-based organization
- ✅ Bundled scripts per skill
- ✅ Self-contained, distributable packages

---

## Changes Applied to Each Skill

### 1. Added YAML Frontmatter

**Example:**
```yaml
---
name: refactoring-specialist
description: This skill should be used when files exceed 300 LOC, tests require extensive mocking (>20 lines), or tight coupling is detected. Automatically refactors code using SOLID principles, spawns specialized agent with design pattern expertise, and validates with automated scripts.
---
```

### 2. Renamed to SKILL.md

- All main skill files now named `SKILL.md`
- Follows skill-creator convention
- Makes skills instantly recognizable

### 3. Organized into Directories

- Each skill in own directory (`skill-name/`)
- Scripts bundled in `skill-name/scripts/`
- Self-contained, distributable

### 4. Bundled Validation Scripts

Each skill includes its relevant scripts:

| Skill | Scripts Included |
|-------|------------------|
| refactoring-specialist | 4 scripts (validate, analyze, placement, suggest) |
| file-placement-enforcer | 2 scripts (validate-placement, suggest-location) |
| docs-standards-validator | 1 script (validate-documentation) |
| optimization-reviewer | 2 scripts (analyze-query, check-bundle) |
| brand-agnostic-checker | 1 script (check-brand-agnostic) |

### 5. Simplified Content

- Removed verbose agent mission templates (keeping concise versions)
- Focused on essential usage information
- Progressive disclosure (SKILL.md → bundled resources)

## Skill Summaries

### refactoring-specialist
**Purpose:** Refactor files exceeding 300 LOC using SOLID principles
**Triggers:** File >300 LOC, complex testing, tight coupling
**Scripts:** 4 validation and analysis scripts

### file-placement-enforcer
**Purpose:** Prevent root clutter, enforce project structure
**Triggers:** File creation, placement validation needed
**Scripts:** 2 placement validation scripts

### docs-standards-validator
**Purpose:** Enforce AI-discoverable documentation standards
**Triggers:** Creating/updating .md files, docs audit
**Scripts:** 1 comprehensive documentation validator

### optimization-reviewer
**Purpose:** Identify performance issues before production
**Triggers:** New API endpoint, database queries, dependencies
**Scripts:** 2 performance analysis scripts

### brand-agnostic-checker
**Purpose:** Enforce multi-tenant architecture
**Triggers:** UI components, customer-facing features
**Scripts:** 1 brand compliance checker

## Validation Results

### Structure Validation ✅
```bash
$ find .claude/skills -type f -name "SKILL.md"
.claude/skills/brand-agnostic-checker/SKILL.md
.claude/skills/docs-standards-validator/SKILL.md
.claude/skills/file-placement-enforcer/SKILL.md
.claude/skills/optimization-reviewer/SKILL.md
.claude/skills/refactoring-specialist/SKILL.md
```

**Result:** All 5 skills have proper SKILL.md files ✅

### Scripts Validation ✅
```bash
$ find .claude/skills -name "*.sh" | wc -l
10
```

**Result:** All 10 validation scripts bundled correctly ✅

### YAML Frontmatter ✅
All SKILL.md files include required frontmatter:
- `name:` field present
- `description:` field present with trigger conditions

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (In Progress)
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with skills framework section
- [ ] Document when Claude should auto-invoke skills
- [ ] Add skills usage guide

### Testing
- [ ] Test skill invocation with skill-creator patterns
- [ ] Verify scripts execute correctly from skill directories
- [ ] Package skills for distribution (optional)

---

## Benefits Achieved

### Discoverability
- ✅ YAML frontmatter enables auto-discovery
- ✅ Proper naming convention (SKILL.md)
- ✅ Clear description triggers

### Organization
- ✅ Self-contained directories
- ✅ Bundled scripts per skill
