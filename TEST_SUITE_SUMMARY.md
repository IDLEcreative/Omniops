   - ✅ Cost tracking ($0.001-0.003 per query)
   - ✅ Reasonable cost efficiency for AI operations

### ❌ Critical Issues Preventing Full Verification

1. **Database Performance Bottlenecks**:
   ```
   [RAG Metadata] Query error: {
     code: '57014', 
     message: 'canceling statement due to statement timeout'
   }
   ```
   - Vector similarity searches timeout frequently
   - Embeddings table queries exceed limits
   - Search operations fail before completion

2. **Search Coverage Limitations**:
   - **Observed**: 2-42 products found for major categories
   - **Expected**: 200+ products for comprehensive searches
   - **Gap**: 80-90% of products may not be discoverable

3. **Response Time Issues**:
   - Average: 20-30 seconds per query
   - Timeout rate: ~60% of complex searches
   - Target: <10 seconds for 90% of queries

4. **WooCommerce Integration Problems**:
   ```
   [WooCommerce Agent] Error: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined
   Order verification error: Request failed with status code 401
   ```

## 📊 Search Coverage Analysis

### From Available System Logs

**Successful Search Examples**:
- ✅ "Cifa" query: 42 results (cached)
- ✅ "hydraulic pump": 43 results (cached)  
- ✅ "DC66-10P Agri Flip": 1 exact match
- ✅ "pumps": 40 results before timeout

**Search Method Breakdown**:
- **Semantic Search**: Primary method using embeddings
- **Keyword Fallback**: Used when semantic search fails
- **Product Enhancement**: Combines multiple content chunks
- **WooCommerce**: Available but has authentication issues

### AI Context Handling Assessment

**Positive Indicators**:
- ✅ AI receives structured search results with counts
- ✅ Product information includes prices, SKUs, specifications
- ✅ Responses are well-organized and user-friendly
- ✅ AI acknowledges limitations when searches fail

**Concerning Indicators**:
- ❌ Context may be incomplete due to search timeouts
- ❌ Large result sets (200+ items) cannot be tested
- ❌ AI may not receive full product catalog scope

## 🚨 Critical Impact Assessment

### High-Impact Issues

1. **Customer Experience Impact**:
   - Customers may not find all available products
   - 20-30 second response times frustrate users
   - Search failures reduce customer confidence

2. **Business Impact**:
   - Potential lost sales from undiscoverable products
   - Poor user experience affects conversion rates
   - AI cannot provide comprehensive product recommendations

3. **Technical Debt**:
   - Database performance issues compound over time
   - Search system cannot scale with growth
   - High operational costs from inefficient queries

### Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Bottleneck**: Database query optimization
- Embeddings table lacks proper indexing
- Vector similarity searches are computationally expensive
- No query result caching implemented
- Connection pooling may be insufficient

**Secondary Issues**: Architecture scalability
- Search timeouts too aggressive (60s default)
- No progressive loading for large result sets
- Limited error recovery mechanisms

## 💡 Recommendations by Priority

### 🔴 Priority 1: Critical Database Optimization

1. **Optimize Embeddings Queries**:

   CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_page_embeddings_embedding 
   ON page_embeddings USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
   ```

2. **Implement Query Result Caching**:
   - Cache common searches (Cifa, pumps, brands)
   - 15-minute TTL for product searches
   - Reduce database load by 70-80%

3. **Add Query Timeouts and Limits**:
   - Limit vector searches to 100 results maximum

   - Add proper error handling and fallbacks
   - Test e-commerce functionality end-to-end

3. **Enhanced Performance Monitoring**:
   - Track product discovery rates
   - Monitor search success/failure ratios
   - Alert on performance degradation

### 🟢 Priority 3: Long-term Enhancements

1. **Search System Redesign**:
   - Consider external search engine (Elasticsearch)
   - Pre-compute common search results
   - Implement materialized views for frequent queries

2. **Comprehensive Testing Framework**:
