# Vector Search Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Vector Search Operator Error - FIXED
**Problem:** The search_embeddings function was failing with "operator does not exist: extensions.vector <=> extensions.vector"
**Solution:** Updated the function to use proper namespace: `OPERATOR(extensions.<=>)` and set search_path

### 2. ✅ Wrong Similarity Threshold - FIXED  
**Problem:** Default threshold of 0.78 was too high for text-embedding-3-small model
**Solution:** Updated thresholds in chat/route.ts from 0.2/0.15/0.3 to 0.6 for all searches

### 3. ✅ Missing Metadata in Results - FIXED
**Problem:** Search results showed as "Untitled" with no URLs
**Solution:** Updated search_embeddings function to JOIN with scraped_pages and return url, title, content

## Test Results

### Vector Search Now Works
```
Query: "Cifa hydraulic pump mixer parts"
Results: 15 items found including:
- 4 CATEGORY pages (CIFA Hydraulic Parts, CIFA Pneumatic Parts, etc.)
- 6 PRODUCT pages (specific pumps and parts)
- All with proper titles and URLs
```

### Category Pages ARE Being Returned
✅ The CIFA Hydraulic Parts category page that Dave wanted IS now in search results
✅ Multiple relevant category pages appear when searching for Cifa products
✅ Both categories and products are returned together

## Remaining Consideration

The AI sometimes chooses not to search immediately for general queries like "Need a pump for my Cifa mixer", instead asking for clarification. This is a separate issue from the vector search functionality, which is now working correctly.

When the AI does search (e.g., "Show me Cifa hydraulic pumps"), it successfully returns:
- Category pages for browsing
- Specific products for purchase
- All with proper metadata

## Files Modified

1. **Database Function:** `search_embeddings` - Added metadata fields and proper vector operator
2. **API Route:** `/app/api/chat/route.ts` - Updated similarity thresholds from 0.2/0.15/0.3 to 0.6
3. **Embeddings Library:** `/lib/embeddings.ts` - Already had correct model (text-embedding-3-small)

## Verification

The vector search system is now fully functional and returns category pages as requested by Dave.
