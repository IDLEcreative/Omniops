## Issue Details

### Issue #1: Alternative Products Hallucination

**Script:** `test-hallucination-prevention.ts`  
**Test:** "Alternative Products" category  
**Status:** Known issue, LOW impact

**Problem:**
When asked "What pump can I use instead of XYZ-123?", the AI suggests specific alternatives without verifying compatibility or existence in inventory.

**Impact:**
- Affects 1 out of 10 test categories (10%)
- Does not block production deployment
- Other 9 categories pass 100%

**Fix Required:**
Update system prompts in `/Users/jamesguy/Omniops/app/api/chat/route.ts` to:
- Require compatibility verification before suggestions
- Admit uncertainty when compatibility data is missing
- Direct users to customer service for alternative recommendations

**Priority:** MEDIUM (fix before promoting alternative product features)
