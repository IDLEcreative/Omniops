-- Migration: Optimize RLS Auth Performance
-- Description: Fix auth_rls_initplan performance issues by wrapping auth.uid(), auth.role(), and auth.jwt() calls
--              with SELECT wrappers to prevent O(n) re-evaluation per row.
-- Impact: Improves query performance for all RLS-protected tables at scale
