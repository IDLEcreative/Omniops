- [x] All tests passing (98/98 tests)
- [x] Real-world validation: 81% quality
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] Git commits pushed to remote
- [x] Feature flags configured

---

## Phase 1: Deploy to Production (10% Traffic)

### Step 1: Configure Production Environment Variables

**On Vercel Dashboard** (or your hosting platform):

```bash
# Navigate to: Project Settings > Environment Variables

# Add these variables for PRODUCTION environment:
USE_ENHANCED_METADATA_CONTEXT=true
USE_GPT5_MINI=true
ENABLE_METADATA_ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE=10

# Keep existing variables:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<existing>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<existing>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<existing>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<existing>
REDIS_URL=<existing>
```

**⚠️ Important:** Add `ENABLE_METADATA_ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE=10` to control gradual rollout.

---

### Step 2: Deploy to Production

**Option A: Vercel CLI**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if not already installed
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Expected output:
# ✓ Production deployment ready
# https://your-domain.com
```

**Option B: Vercel Dashboard**
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click "Deployments" tab
4. Click "Deploy" button
5. Select branch: `main`
6. Wait for deployment to complete (~2-3 minutes)

**Option C: GitHub Integration (Automatic)**
- If Vercel is connected to GitHub, deployment happens automatically on push to main
- Check deployment status at: https://vercel.com/dashboard

---

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

**Test 1: Health Check**
```bash
curl https://your-production-domain.com/api/health

# Expected response:
# {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"2025-10-27T..."}
```

**Test 2: Chat API with Metadata**
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-production-domain.com/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Do you have hydraulic pumps?",
    "domain": "thompsonseparts.co.uk"
  }'

# Expected: Response should include context tracking
# Check for natural language (not "Referring to...")
```

**Test 3: Feature Flag Verification**
```bash
# Check Vercel environment variables
vercel env ls

# Verify these are set:
# ✓ USE_ENHANCED_METADATA_CONTEXT = true
# ✓ USE_GPT5_MINI = true
# ✓ ENABLE_METADATA_ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE = 10
```

---

### Step 4: Monitor Initial Traffic (Days 1-2)

**Monitor These Metrics:**

1. **Response Quality**
   ```bash
   # Check logs for "robotic language" patterns
   vercel logs --follow

   # Look for complaints about:
   # - "Too formal responses"
   # - "Sounds like a robot"
   # - "Doesn't remember context"
   ```

2. **Error Rates**
   ```bash
   # Watch for increased error rates
   # Acceptable: <1% error rate
   # Warning: 1-5% error rate
   # Critical: >5% error rate (ROLLBACK)
   ```

3. **Response Times**
   ```bash
   # Check API response times
   # Target: <2 seconds (including AI processing)
   # Warning: 2-5 seconds
   # Critical: >5 seconds (ROLLBACK)
   ```

**Success Criteria for Phase 1:**
- [ ] Zero critical errors
- [ ] Error rate <1%
- [ ] Response times <2 seconds average
- [ ] No user complaints about "robotic" responses
- [ ] Context tracking working correctly

**If Phase 1 is Successful:** Proceed to Phase 2 after 48 hours

**If Issues Occur:** Execute rollback procedure (see below)

---

## Phase 2: Scale to 50% Traffic (Days 3-4)

### Update Environment Variable

**On Vercel Dashboard:**
```bash
# Change this variable:
ENABLE_METADATA_ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE=50  # Was: 10

# Redeploy (automatic if using Vercel)
# Or trigger manual redeploy:
vercel --prod
```

**Monitor for 48 hours** using same metrics as Phase 1

**Success Criteria for Phase 2:**
- [ ] Error rate still <1%
- [ ] Response times stable
- [ ] No increase in user complaints
- [ ] Positive feedback on conversation quality

---

## Phase 3: Scale to 100% Traffic (Day 5+)

### Update Environment Variable

**On Vercel Dashboard:**
```bash
# Change this variable:
ENABLE_METADATA_ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE=100  # Was: 50

# Or remove the variable entirely to use default (100%)
# Redeploy
vercel --prod
```

**Monitor for 7 days** before considering deployment complete

**Success Criteria for Phase 3:**
- [ ] Error rate <1%
- [ ] Response times stable
- [ ] User satisfaction maintained or improved
- [ ] Context tracking performing as expected

---

## Instant Rollback Procedure

**If any critical issues occur, execute this immediately:**

### Step 1: Disable Feature (< 1 minute)

**On Vercel Dashboard:**
```bash
# Change this variable:
USE_ENHANCED_METADATA_CONTEXT=false  # Was: true

# This immediately disables metadata context injection
# No code deployment needed!
```

### Step 2: Verify Rollback

```bash
# Test that system reverted to baseline behavior
curl -X POST https://your-production-domain.com/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Test message",
    "domain": "test.com"
  }'

# Expected: Should NOT include enhanced metadata context
# Response should be baseline behavior (pre-Week 1)
```

### Step 3: Investigate Issue

```bash
# Check recent logs
vercel logs --since=1h

# Look for error patterns
# Document issue in GitHub Issues
```

### Step 4: Deploy Fix

```bash
# Make code fixes in development
# Test locally
# Deploy to staging first
# Then re-enable feature flag

USE_ENHANCED_METADATA_CONTEXT=true
```

---

## Monitoring Commands

### Real-Time Log Monitoring

```bash
# Watch production logs
vercel logs --follow

# Filter for errors only
vercel logs --follow | grep ERROR

# Filter for metadata-related logs
vercel logs --follow | grep "ConversationMetadata"
```

### Performance Metrics

```bash
# Check deployment metrics
vercel inspect <deployment-url>

# View analytics
# Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard > Analytics
```

### Database Monitoring

```bash
# Check Supabase dashboard
# URL: https://app.supabase.com/project/birugqyuqhiahxvxeyqg

# Monitor these tables:
# - conversations (new conversation creation rate)
# - messages (message volume)
# - conversation_metadata (metadata tracking)

# Query to check metadata usage:
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_conversations,
       COUNT(metadata) as conversations_with_metadata,
       ROUND(COUNT(metadata)::numeric / COUNT(*)::numeric * 100, 2) as metadata_percentage
FROM conversations
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Responses still sound robotic"

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check if feature flag is actually enabled
vercel env ls | grep USE_ENHANCED_METADATA_CONTEXT

# Should show: USE_ENHANCED_METADATA_CONTEXT=true
```

**Fix:**
- This is expected for ~25% of responses (per validation report)
- Monitor user complaints
- If >10% of users complain, escalate to Week 3 optimization

---

### Issue: "Context not being remembered"

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check database for metadata tracking
# Connect to Supabase and run:
SELECT * FROM conversation_metadata
WHERE conversation_id = '<test-conversation-id>'
LIMIT 5;

# Should show entities, corrections, lists being tracked
```

**Fix:**
- Verify ConversationMetadataManager is being instantiated
- Check logs for "ConversationMetadata" entries
- May need to debug metadata extraction logic

---

### Issue: "Increased error rates"

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check error logs
vercel logs --follow | grep -i error

# Common causes:
# - OpenAI API rate limits
# - Supabase connection issues
# - Metadata serialization errors
```

**Fix:**
- Identify error pattern
- If OpenAI: may need rate limit adjustment
- If Supabase: check connection pool settings
- If serialization: may need schema adjustment

---

### Issue: "Slow response times"

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check response time distribution
# Analyze in Vercel Analytics dashboard

# Compare with baseline:
# Baseline (no metadata): ~1.2s average
# With metadata: ~1.4s average (+200ms acceptable)
# Warning: >2s average
```

**Fix:**
- Target metadata overhead: <50ms (currently achieving <25ms)
- If >100ms overhead: investigate metadata extraction performance
- May need to optimize ConversationMetadataManager.generateContextSummary()

---

## Post-Deployment Tasks

### Week 1 Checklist (After 100% Rollout)

- [ ] Collect 100+ real conversation samples
- [ ] Analyze conversation quality distribution
- [ ] Identify common "robotic language" patterns
- [ ] Document user feedback themes
- [ ] Decide if Week 3 optimization is needed

### Optional: Week 3 Optimization

**Trigger Conditions:**
- >10% of users report "robotic" responses
- Real-world quality drops below 75%
- Specific language patterns identified for improvement

**If triggered:**
- Analyze collected real conversation data
- Create Variant C prompt focusing on identified issues
- Test against real conversation samples
- Target: 90%+ real-world quality

---

## Success Metrics
