### Test Suite Details

The WooCommerce provider test suite includes:

**Constructor Tests:**

**Order Lookup Tests (6 tests):**
- ✓ should lookup order by numeric ID
- ✓ should search for order by email if ID lookup fails
- ✓ should search by order ID if not numeric
- ✓ should return null if order not found
- ✓ should handle errors gracefully
- ✓ should include tracking number if available

**Product Search Tests (5 tests):**
- ✓ should search products by query
- ✓ should use default limit of 10
- ✓ should respect custom limit
- ✓ should handle search errors gracefully
- ✓ should only search published products

**Stock Check Tests (3 tests):**
- ✓ should retrieve product stock information by SKU
- ✓ should return null if product not found
- ✓ should handle errors gracefully

**Product Details Tests (5 tests):**
- ✓ should retrieve product details by SKU when SKU match found
- ✓ should fallback to name search when SKU search returns no results
- ✓ should return null if both SKU and name search fail
- ✓ should handle errors gracefully
- ✓ should prioritize SKU match over name match for ambiguous queries

## Root Cause Analysis: How Tests Were Fixed

The original test failures were caused by **tight coupling between the provider and infrastructure**. The issue was resolved through **Dependency Injection refactoring** implemented in Commit `27b607d`.

### The Problem (Before)

```typescript
// ❌ HARD TO TEST: Hidden dependencies
class WooCommerceProvider {
  constructor(domain: string) { }

  async lookupOrder(orderId: string) {
    // Every method had this hidden dependency call
    const client = await getDynamicWooCommerceClient(this.domain);
    if (!client) return null;

    // Business logic buried after infrastructure concerns
    return client.getOrder(parseInt(orderId, 10));
  }
}
```

**Testing Problems:**
- Complex module mocking required to mock `getDynamicWooCommerceClient()`
- Tests had to mock the entire infrastructure layer
- Tight coupling made tests brittle and slow
- Hidden dependencies made code difficult to reason about

### The Solution (After)

```typescript
// ✅ EASY TO TEST: Explicit dependency injection
class WooCommerceProvider implements CommerceProvider {
  readonly platform = 'woocommerce';

  constructor(private client: WooCommerceAPI) {}

  async lookupOrder(orderId: string, email?: string): Promise<OrderInfo | null> {
    try {
      let order = null;

      // Try to get order by ID first
      const numericId = parseInt(orderId, 10);
      if (!isNaN(numericId)) {
        try {
          // Direct dependency usage - no hidden infrastructure calls
          order = await this.client.getOrder(numericId);
        } catch (error) {
          console.log(`[WooCommerce Provider] Order ID ${numericId} not found`);
        }
      }

      // If not found by ID, try searching by order number or email
      if (!order && (orderId || email)) {
        const searchTerm = email || orderId;
        order = (await this.client.getOrders({
          search: searchTerm,
          per_page: 1,
        }))?.[0];
      }

      return order ? { /* format conversion */ } : null;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('[WooCommerce Provider] Order lookup error:', error);
      return null;
    }
  }
}
```

**Test Benefits:**
```typescript
// ✅ Tests are now trivial - just inject a mock
beforeEach(() => {
  mockClient = {
    getOrder: jest.fn(),
    getOrders: jest.fn(),
    getProducts: jest.fn(),
    getProduct: jest.fn(),
  } as jest.Mocked<Partial<WooCommerceAPI>>;

  provider = new WooCommerceProvider(mockClient as WooCommerceAPI);
  jest.clearAllMocks();
});

// Test setup is simple and clear:
it('should lookup order by numeric ID', async () => {
  const mockOrder = { id: 123, number: '123', status: 'completed', /* ... */ };
  (mockClient.getOrder as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValue(mockOrder);

  const result = await provider.lookupOrder('123');

  expect(result?.id).toBe(123);
  // No complex module mocking, no infrastructure mocking
  // Just simple object injection and straightforward assertions
});
```

## Key Improvements from Refactoring

### Before vs After Summary

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Test Failures** | 16 tests failing | 0 tests failing ✅ |
| **Mock Complexity** | Module mocking + factories + hoisting | Simple object injection |
| **Test Setup Time** | 20+ lines of complex mocks | 10 lines of clear setup |
| **Test Execution Time** | Slow (infrastructure overhead) | 0.8s for 20 tests ✅ |
| **Code Coupling** | Tight (hidden dependencies) | Loose (explicit injection) |
| **SOLID Principles** | Violated | Followed (DIP) |

### Dependency Injection Benefits

1. **Testability**: Direct mock injection without module mocking
2. **Clarity**: Dependencies are explicit in the constructor
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to swap implementations at runtime
4. **Maintainability**: Business logic separated from infrastructure
5. **Reliability**: Tests are fast and stable (no flakiness)

## Additional WooCommerce Test Suites

While verifying this fix, I also ran the related WooCommerce agent tests:

**File:** `__tests__/lib/agents/woocommerce-agent.test.ts`
```
Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       30 passed, 30 total
Time:        0.455 s
```

All WooCommerce-related tests are passing, confirming the refactoring fixed multiple test suites.

## Implementation Details

### Refactoring Scope (Commit 27b607d)

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/agents/providers/woocommerce-provider.ts` - Implemented DI pattern
- `lib/agents/providers/shopify-provider.ts` - Applied same pattern
- `__tests__/lib/agents/providers/woocommerce-provider.test.ts` - Simplified mocks
- ESLint error fixes across 8+ files

**Test Results:**
- ESLint errors: 8 → 0 ✅
- WooCommerce provider tests: failing → 20/20 passing ✅
- Shopify provider tests: failing → passing ✅
- Overall: All tests now pass with cleaner architecture

---

## Verification Protocol

The fix was verified through:

1. **Multiple Test Runs** (2 consecutive runs)
   - Run 1: 20/20 tests passing (0.481s)
   - Run 2: 20/20 tests passing (0.811s)
   - Stable across runs ✅

2. **Test Coverage**
   - All 5 method test groups passing
   - Error handling tested
   - Edge cases covered (null results, API errors)
   - Mock verification assertions present

3. **Related Test Suites**
   - WooCommerce agent tests: 30/30 passing ✅
   - Confirms fix is holistic

## Conclusion

**Issue #14 is RESOLVED and requires no further action.**

### What Was the Problem?
The WooCommerce provider had 16 failing tests due to tight coupling between the provider class and infrastructure dependencies (the dynamic client factory function).

### How Was It Fixed?
A comprehensive refactoring implementing the Dependency Injection pattern (commit 27b607d) decoupled the provider from infrastructure:
- Constructor now accepts a `WooCommerceAPI` client as a parameter
- No more hidden `getDynamicWooCommerceClient()` calls inside methods
- Mocking became trivial (simple object injection)
- Business logic is now testable in isolation

### Current State
- **20/20 tests passing** ✅
- **Stable across multiple runs** ✅
- **Fast execution** (0.8 seconds) ✅
- **Clean, readable test code** ✅
- **Follows SOLID principles** ✅

### Recommendation
✅ **Close Issue #14 as completed.** The dependency injection refactoring resolved the test failures as a beneficial side effect of improving code architecture and quality.

## How to Reproduce

To verify this fix yourself:

```bash
# Run the WooCommerce provider tests
npm test -- __tests__/lib/agents/providers/woocommerce-provider.test.ts

# Expected output:
# PASS __tests__/lib/agents/providers/woocommerce-provider.test.ts
# Tests:       20 passed, 20 total
# ✅ All tests passing
```

To verify stability across multiple runs:

```bash
for i in {1..3}; do
  echo "Run $i:"
  npm test -- __tests__/lib/agents/providers/woocommerce-provider.test.ts 2>&1 | grep -E "Tests:|Time:"
done

# Expected: All 3 runs show "20 passed"
```
