# Customer Satisfaction Journey Testing

This document describes the comprehensive customer satisfaction testing framework created to verify that the AI chat system achieves 100% customer satisfaction through realistic customer journey simulations.

## Overview

The testing framework simulates real customer interactions to ensure the AI:
- Finds ALL relevant products for customer queries
- Preserves context across multi-step conversations  
- Effectively narrows down results based on customer refinements
- Provides complete product information and pricing
- Achieves high customer satisfaction scores

## Test Files Created

### 1. `test-customer-satisfaction-journey.ts` - Comprehensive Test Suite

**Purpose**: Full customer journey simulation with detailed scoring and analysis

**Test Scenarios**:
- **Scenario A: Broad to Specific** - Tests progressive narrowing from "Cifa parts" → "hydraulic ones" → "under £200"
- **Scenario B: Specific Part Search** - Tests exact part lookup and specification requests
- **Scenario C: Problem-Based Search** - Tests solution-oriented queries like "mixer needs water pump"
- **Scenario D: Price-Conscious Customer** - Tests price-based product discovery

**Key Features**:
- Multi-step conversation tracking
- Context preservation analysis
- Product finding accuracy scoring
- Response time monitoring
- Comprehensive satisfaction scoring (0-100)
- Detailed issue identification

### 2. `test-customer-satisfaction-journey-quick.ts` - Fast Validation Test

**Purpose**: Quick smoke test for rapid feedback during development

**Features**:
- Reduced timeouts for faster execution
- Simplified scenarios for core functionality validation
- Quick pass/fail assessment
- Ideal for CI/CD integration

## Scoring System

### Satisfaction Score Components (0-100 points):

1. **Response Quality (40 points)**:
   - Detailed response (10 pts)
   - Brand relevance (Cifa mentions) (10 pts)  
   - Pricing information (10 pts)
   - Comprehensive content (10 pts)

2. **Product Discovery (30 points)**:
   - Products found (15 pts)
   - Multiple products (10 pts)
   - Extensive catalog (5 pts)

3. **Context Preservation (20 points)**:
   - Acknowledges previous conversation
   - References earlier queries
   - Builds on previous results

4. **Expected Outcome Matching (10 points)**:
   - Meets specific scenario expectations

### Success Criteria:
- **Excellent**: 90+ average satisfaction, 80%+ success rate
- **Good**: 80+ average satisfaction, 70%+ success rate  
- **Needs Improvement**: 70+ average satisfaction, 60%+ success rate
- **Poor**: Below 70 average satisfaction

## Test Results Analysis

### Quick Test Results:
```
Average Satisfaction: 68/100
Success Rate: 50%
Status: ⚠️ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
```

### Key Findings:

1. **Product Discovery**: ✅ Good
   - Successfully finds 15+ Cifa products
   - Broad category coverage
   - Price information included

2. **Response Time**: ⚠️ Needs Improvement
   - 12-20 second response times
   - Database timeout issues observed
   - Redis connectivity problems

3. **Context Preservation**: ❌ Poor
   - Limited acknowledgment of previous queries
   - Session continuity issues
   - Conversation history not effectively utilized

4. **Specific Search Accuracy**: ⚠️ Mixed Results
   - General queries work well
   - Specific part searches sometimes fail
   - Water pump search returned no results despite having inventory

## Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. Context Preservation Enhancement
- Implement better conversation memory
- Add explicit conversation history tracking
- Enhance prompt engineering for context awareness

### 2. Performance Optimization  
- Reduce database query timeouts
- Implement Redis connection pooling
- Optimize search algorithms for faster response

### 3. Search Accuracy Improvements
- Enhance semantic search for specific parts
- Improve product name matching algorithms
- Add synonym and variation handling

### 4. Response Quality Enhancement
- Add more detailed product specifications
- Improve price presentation formatting
- Enhance recommendation algorithms

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Comprehensive Test:
```bash
npx tsx test-customer-satisfaction-journey.ts
```

### Running the Quick Test:
```bash
npx tsx test-customer-satisfaction-journey-quick.ts
```

### Test Configuration:
- Domain: `thompsonseparts.co.uk`
- API Endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/api/chat-intelligent`
- Timeout: 25 seconds (comprehensive), 20 seconds (quick)
- Max Search Iterations: 2 (optimized for speed)

## Integration with Development Workflow

1. **Pre-commit**: Run quick test to ensure basic functionality
2. **PR Testing**: Run comprehensive test for full validation
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Track satisfaction scores over time
4. **Regression Testing**: Verify improvements don't break existing functionality

## Future Enhancements

1. **A/B Testing Framework**: Compare different AI configurations
2. **Real User Journey Capture**: Import actual customer conversations
3. **Performance Benchmarking**: Track improvements over time
4. **Multi-Domain Testing**: Test across different customer websites
5. **Conversation Flow Optimization**: Advanced context preservation testing
