# Test Timeout Fix - Execution Plan

## Phase 1: Identify the Blocker (5 min)
1. Run test with `--detectOpenHandles` to see what's keeping event loop alive
2. Check for timers, connections, or listeners not being cleaned up

## Phase 2: Fix Cleanup Issues (10 min)
1. Add proper `afterEach` cleanup in test files
2. Ensure Redis mock disconnects properly
3. Clear all timers and intervals
4. Add explicit cleanup for telemetry mocks

## Phase 3: Verify & Test (10 min)
1. Run single test case to verify fix
2. Run full test suite
3. Verify all 12+3 tests pass
4. Check test execution time (<30 seconds)

## Phase 4: Document (5 min)
1. Update test helpers with usage examples
2. Create summary of what was fixed
3. Clean up diagnostic files

**Total Time**: ~30 minutes
**Expected Outcome**: All tests passing in <30 seconds
