## 3. Optimization Opportunities

### 3.1 Immediate Optimizations (Quick Wins)

#### A. Reduce AI Processing Time
```typescript
// Current: GPT-4 for all calls
const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4',  // 2-3s latency
  // ...
});

// Optimized: Use GPT-3.5-turbo for tool calls
const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: toolCall ? 'gpt-3.5-turbo' : 'gpt-4',  // 0.5-1s for tools
  // ...
});
```
**Expected Impact**: 40-50% reduction in AI processing time

#### B. Implement Response Streaming
```typescript
// Stream responses to user while processing continues
const stream = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4',
  stream: true,
  // ...
});

// User sees content immediately
for await (const chunk of stream) {
  // Send chunk to client
}
```
**Expected Impact**: Perceived latency reduction of 1-2 seconds

#### C. Cache Common Searches
```typescript
const cacheKey = `search_${domain}_${queryHash}`;
const cached = await cache.get(cacheKey);

if (cached && Date.now() - cached.timestamp < 3600000) {
  return cached.results; // Instant response
}
```
**Expected Impact**: 90% reduction for repeated queries

### 3.2 Medium-Term Optimizations

#### A. Parallel Tool Execution
```typescript
// Current: Sequential tool calls
for (const toolCall of toolCalls) {
  const result = await executeTool(toolCall);
}

// Optimized: Parallel execution
const results = await Promise.all(
  toolCalls.map(toolCall => executeTool(toolCall))
);
```
**Expected Impact**: 30-40% reduction in search time

#### B. Smart Iteration Management
```typescript
// Reduce iterations for simple queries
const maxIterations = isSimpleQuery(message) ? 1 : 3;

// Skip search for greetings/simple responses
if (isGreeting(message) || isThanks(message)) {
  return directResponse(); // Skip all search operations
}
```
**Expected Impact**: 50% reduction for simple queries

#### C. Database Query Optimization
```sql
-- Add indexes for frequently queried fields
CREATE INDEX idx_domains_domain ON domains(domain);
CREATE INDEX idx_conversations_session ON conversations(session_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_messages_conversation ON messages(conversation_id);
```
**Expected Impact**: 50-70% reduction in DB query time

### 3.3 Long-Term Optimizations

#### A. Implement Edge Caching
- Deploy edge functions closer to users
- Cache embeddings at edge locations
- Reduce round-trip latency

#### B. Custom Fine-Tuned Models
- Fine-tune smaller models for specific tasks
- Reduce model size and latency
- Improve accuracy for domain-specific queries

#### C. Asynchronous Processing Pipeline
- Queue non-critical operations
- Process searches in background
- Return preliminary results immediately

## 5. Memory Usage Analysis

### Current State
- Intelligent Route: 13.04 MB average
- Old Route: -11.37 MB (baseline)
- Difference: +24.42 MB increase

### Memory Hotspots
1. **Tool call accumulation**: Results stored for all iterations
2. **Message history**: Full conversation context retained
3. **Search results**: All chunks kept in memory

### Optimization Strategy
```typescript
// Clear intermediate results after processing
toolResults = null;
searchResults = processAndRelease(searchResults);

// Stream large result sets
async function* streamResults() {
  for await (const chunk of searchChunks) {
    yield processChunk(chunk);
    // Release chunk from memory
  }
}
```

## 6. Algorithmic Complexity Analysis

### Current Implementation

| Operation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| Search Iterations | O(n × m) | O(n × m) |
| Result Processing | O(n log n) | O(n) |
| Context Building | O(n²) | O(n) |
| Response Generation | O(n) | O(n) |

Where:
- n = number of search results
- m = number of iterations

### Optimization Targets

1. **Reduce Context Building to O(n)**
   - Use hash maps for deduplication
   - Stream processing instead of batch

2. **Implement Result Pagination O(1)**
   - Return only top-k results
   - Lazy-load additional results

3. **Cache Embeddings O(1)**
   - Pre-computed embeddings for common queries
   - In-memory cache with LRU eviction
