# Phase 1 Deployment - SUCCESS âœ…

**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Status:** Deployed to Production
**Traffic:** 10% (via `ENABLE_METADATA_ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE=10`)

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 1 of the conversation metadata tracking system has been successfully deployed to production. After troubleshooting environment configuration issues, the system is now working correctly with GPT-5 mini and enhanced metadata context.

---

## Deployment Timeline

### 21:00 UTC - Initial Deployment
- Configured environment variables:
  - `USE_GPT5_MINI=true`
  - `USE_ENHANCED_METADATA_CONTEXT=true`
  - `ENABLE_METADATA_ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE=10`
- Deployed to production

### 21:10 UTC - Issue Discovery
- Tests failing with "Failed to process chat message"
- Investigation revealed two issues:
  1. `USE_GPT5_MINI` had trailing newline (`"true\n"`)
  2. Test requests used unconfigured domain

### 21:15 UTC - Environment Variable Fix
- Removed and re-added `USE_GPT5_MINI` without trailing newline
- Value changed from `"true\n"` to `"true"`
- Redeployed to production

### 21:20 UTC - Validation Success
- Tested with configured domain (`thompsonseparts.co.uk`)
- System working perfectly:
  - GPT-5 mini responding correctly
  - Metadata tracking active
  - Search tools functional
  - Source attribution included

### 21:25 UTC - Code Cleanup
- Removed diagnostic logging
- Final production deployment
- **Status:** READY FOR MONITORING

---

## What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Environment Variable Trailing Newline
**Problem:**
```bash
USE_GPT5_MINI="true\n"  # Had newline inside quotes
```

**Impact:**
- `process.env.USE_GPT5_MINI === 'true'` returned `false`
- Triggered error: "USE_GPT5_MINI must be set to true"
- GPT-5 mini never actually ran

**Resolution:**
```bash
printf "true" | vercel env add USE_GPT5_MINI production
# Result: USE_GPT5_MINI="true" (no trailing newline)
```

### Issue 2: Unconfigured Domain Testing
**Problem:**
- Tested with `domain: "www.omniops.co.uk"`
- This domain not configured in `customer_configs` table
- `domain_id` is NOT NULL in `conversations` table
- Database constraint violation: "null value in column domain_id"

**Resolution:**
- Test with actual configured domain: `thompsonseparts.co.uk`
- System works perfectly with valid domains

---

## Production Validation

### Test 1: Simple Query
**Request:**
```json
{
  "message": "Hello, do you have any products?",
  "session_id": "correct-domain-test",
  "domain": "thompsonseparts.co.uk"
}
```

**Response:** âœ… SUCCESS
- Returned product categories
- Used semantic search
- Included 4 source references
- Conversation tracking active
- Metadata context working

### Test 2: Specific Product Search
**Request:**
```json
{
  "message": "Do you have Cifa hydraulic pumps?",
  "session_id": "final-validation",
  "domain": "thompsonseparts.co.uk"
}
```

**Response:** âœ… SUCCESS
- Found 5 specific Cifa hydraulic pumps
- Accurate product names and part numbers
- Follow-up clarification questions
- Source attribution included
- GPT-5 mini reasoning active

---

## Current Production Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
USE_GPT5_MINI=true
USE_ENHANCED_METADATA_CONTEXT=true
ENABLE_METADATA_ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE=10
OPENAI_API_KEY=[Set 60d ago]
```

### Feature Flags
- **GPT-5 mini:** Enabled for all conversations
- **Metadata Context:** Always injected (production-ready)
- **Rollout Percentage:** 10% of traffic receives metadata tracking
- **Model:** `gpt-5-mini` with `reasoning_effort: 'low'`

### Active Features
1. âœ… ConversationMetadataManager tracking entities
2. âœ… ResponseParser extracting corrections and lists
3. âœ… Enhanced system prompts with conversation context
4. âœ… Turn counter and state management
5. âœ… Metadata serialization to database

---

## Monitoring Plan (Next 48 Hours)

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Conversation Quality**
   - Response accuracy
   - Entity tracking accuracy
   - Correction detection rate
   - List comprehension

2. **System Performance**
   - Average response time
   - OpenAI API latency
   - Database query performance
   - Error rates

3. **User Experience**
   - Conversation flow naturalness
   - Context retention across turns
   - Pronoun resolution accuracy
   - Follow-up question relevance

### Daily Checkpoints
- **Morning (9:00 UTC):** Review overnight logs
- **Midday (13:00 UTC):** Check performance metrics
- **Evening (18:00 UTC):** Analyze conversation quality
- **Night (22:00 UTC):** Daily summary report

### Success Criteria for Phase 2
- âœ… No critical errors
- âœ… Response time < 3 seconds (p95)
- âœ… Conversation accuracy maintained or improved
- âœ… No user complaints
- âœ… Metadata tracking working correctly

---

## What's Next

### Phase 2 (After 48 Hours)
If Phase 1 monitoring shows success:
- Increase to 50% traffic
- Monitor for 24 hours
- Prepare for full rollout

### Phase 3 (After Phase 2)
- 100% traffic rollout
- Remove feature flags
- Make metadata tracking permanent
- Document lessons learned

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Environment Variable Formatting Matters**
   - Always verify environment variables don't have trailing characters
   - Use `printf` instead of `echo` to avoid newlines
   - Check values with `od -c` to see hidden characters

2. **Test with Real Data**
   - Always test with configured domains
   - Don't assume test data will work in production
   - Validate database constraints early

3. **Diagnostic Logging is Valuable**
   - Temporary diagnostic logging helped identify root cause
   - Remove after issue resolution
   - Keep production logs clean

4. **User Feedback is Gold**
   - User questioned assumptions: "what makes you sure it's not working"
   - This prompted deeper investigation
   - Led to discovering real issue (wrong domain)

## Support Information

### If Issues Arise
1. Check Vercel logs: `vercel logs https://www.omniops.co.uk`
2. Monitor error rates in telemetry system
3. Test with: `curl -X POST https://www.omniops.co.uk/api/chat -d '{"message":"test","session_id":"test","domain":"thompsonseparts.co.uk"}'`
4. Roll back if critical: Set `USE_ENHANCED_METADATA_CONTEXT=false`

### Emergency Rollback
```bash
# Disable metadata context
vercel env rm USE_ENHANCED_METADATA_CONTEXT production -y
vercel env add USE_ENHANCED_METADATA_CONTEXT production # Enter: false
vercel --prod
```
