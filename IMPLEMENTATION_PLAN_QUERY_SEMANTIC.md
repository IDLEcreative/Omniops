# Implementation Plan: Query Enhancement & Semantic Chunking

## Phase 1: Query Enhancement Integration (Already Built)
The QueryEnhancer class is already created at `/lib/query-enhancer.ts` but needs integration.

### 1.1 Integration Points
- [ ] Integrate QueryEnhancer into smartSearch function
- [ ] Update chat API to use enhanced queries
- [ ] Add query caching for performance
- [ ] Implement query intent routing

### 1.2 Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for synonym expansion
- [ ] Tests for spelling correction
- [ ] Intent detection accuracy tests
- [ ] End-to-end search quality tests

## Phase 2: Semantic Chunking Implementation

### 2.1 Core Components to Build
```typescript
// lib/semantic-chunker.ts
interface SemanticChunk {
  content: string;
  type: 'paragraph' | 'section' | 'list' | 'table' | 'code';
  parent_heading: string;
  semantic_completeness: number;
  boundary_type: 'natural' | 'forced' | 'overlap';
  overlap_with_previous: string;
  overlap_with_next: string;
}
```

### 2.2 Implementation Steps
1. **Boundary Detection**
   - HTML heading detection (h1-h6)
   - Paragraph boundaries
   - List and table detection
   - Code block preservation

2. **Context Preservation**
   - 100-200 char overlap between chunks
   - Parent heading inheritance
   - Semantic completeness scoring

3. **Size Management**
   - Min chunk size: 500 chars
   - Max chunk size: 2000 chars
   - Adaptive sizing based on content type

### 2.3 Integration Points
- [ ] Update scraper-worker.js to use semantic chunking
- [ ] Modify embeddings.ts chunking logic
- [ ] Update metadata extractor for chunk types
- [ ] Add database field for chunk metadata

## Phase 3: Testing & Validation

### 3.1 Unit Tests
- Query enhancement accuracy
- Semantic boundary detection
- Chunk overlap validation
- Metadata extraction verification

### 3.2 Integration Tests
- End-to-end search quality
- Performance benchmarks
- Memory usage monitoring
- Error handling scenarios

### 3.3 A/B Testing
- Compare old vs new search results
- Measure relevance improvements
- Track user satisfaction metrics

## Phase 4: Agent Deployment Strategy

### Agents to Deploy:
1. **general-purpose**: Implement semantic chunking core
2. **code-reviewer**: Review implementations
3. **performance-profiler**: Analyze performance impact
4. **code-quality-validator**: Ensure code quality

## Success Metrics
- 30% improvement in search relevance
- 20% reduction in query reformulations
- Maintain sub-200ms search latency
- Zero regression in existing functionality

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 1 day (integration of existing QueryEnhancer)
- Phase 2: 2 days (semantic chunking implementation)
- Phase 3: 1 day (testing and validation)
- Phase 4: Continuous (agent monitoring)
