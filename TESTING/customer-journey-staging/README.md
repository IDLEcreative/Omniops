## üí° Testing Tips

1. **Actually Pretend:** Don't cheat by looking at code. Experience what customers experience.

2. **Document Immediately:** Write down issues AS YOU FIND THEM. Don't trust your memory.

3. **Take Screenshots:** Visual evidence is gold for debugging.

4. **Test Edge Cases:** Try weird queries, break things intentionally.

5. **Compare Constantly:** Keep production open in another tab for A/B comparison.

6. **Time Yourself:** Note how long each phase takes - this reveals UX friction.

7. **Think Out Loud:** Imagine explaining each step to a non-technical person. If it's hard to explain, it's probably too complex.

## üêõ Reporting Issues

**When you find an issue:**

1. Stop and document it immediately in FINDINGS_AND_ISSUES.md
2. Include:
   - Phase/step where it occurred
   - What you expected
   - What actually happened
   - Error messages (console, network tab)
   - Screenshot (if relevant)
3. Rate severity (üî¥/üü†/üü°/üü¢)
4. Add to todo list if it needs fixing
5. Continue testing

**For critical issues:**
- Note in a new conversation: "Found critical issue at Phase X"
- Include exact reproduction steps
- Claude will help debug immediately
