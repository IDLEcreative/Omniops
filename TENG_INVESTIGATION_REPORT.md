# Teng Products Investigation Report

**Domain**: thompsonseparts.co.uk  
**Date**: September 8, 2025  
**Investigation Query**: "Teng torque" products not showing in chat responses  

## Executive Summary

The investigation revealed that **Thompson's E Parts does not actually sell Teng Tools products**. The "Teng" mentions found in the database are **navigation menu items only**, not actual product listings. This explains why customers asking about "Teng torque" products are not getting relevant results.

## Key Findings

### 1. Domain Analysis
- **Company**: Thompson's E Parts
- **Business Type**: Tipper, trailer, and truck parts supplier
- **Total Pages Scraped**: 3,925 pages
- **Last Scraped**: August 25, 2025
- **Status**: Active

### 2. Teng Mentions Analysis
- **Total pages with "Teng"**: 10 pages
- **Navigation/Menu mentions**: 10 pages (100%)
- **Actual Teng product pages**: 0 pages (0%)
- **Pattern**: All mentions are in the site's navigation structure

### 3. Content Pattern
All "Teng" mentions follow this exact pattern in the navigation:
```
Hand Tools Pressure Washers Air Tools & Accessories Powered Tools Hyundai Power Products TENG TOOLS
```

This appears to be a menu item that links to a Teng Tools section, but **no actual Teng Tools products are found in the scraped content**.

### 4. Search Function Testing
- **Function**: `search_content_optimized` exists and works correctly
- **Correct Parameters**: `(match_count, p_domain_id, query_embedding, query_text, use_hybrid)`
- **Results for "Teng torque"**: 10 results returned, but focused on "torque" products from other brands:
  - Dawbarn Hydroclear torque arms
  - Blue Spot Tools torque wrench
  - Martins Impulse torque wrenches
- **No Teng-specific results**: Confirming no actual Teng Tools products exist

### 5. Related Product Analysis
The search did find legitimate torque-related products:
- **Blue Spot Tools 1/2" Torque Wrench**
- **Martins Impulse Analog Torque Wrenches** (various sizes)
- **Dawbarn Hydroclear Torque Arms** (for roll-over sheet systems)

## Technical Findings

### Database Status
- **Embeddings**: 27 page embeddings exist for Teng-related pages
- **Content Embeddings**: 0 content embeddings for the domain
- **Function Signature**: Corrected parameter mismatch in search function calls

### Search Function Issues Fixed
- **Previous Error**: `match_threshold` parameter doesn't exist
- **Correct Parameters**: 
  - `query_text`: The search query
  - `query_embedding`: Vector embedding (can be null)
  - `p_domain_id`: Domain UUID
  - `match_count`: Number of results to return
  - `use_hybrid`: Boolean for hybrid search mode

## Root Cause

The issue is **not a technical problem** with the search system, but rather:

1. **Business Mismatch**: Thompson's E Parts is a commercial vehicle parts supplier, not a hand tools retailer
2. **Menu vs. Products**: The "TENG TOOLS" appears only as a navigation menu item, possibly linking to an external site or empty section
3. **Customer Expectations**: Customers may be confused by the navigation showing "TENG TOOLS" but not finding actual products

## Recommendations

### 1. Customer Communication
- **Update Chat Responses**: Clarify that Thompson's E Parts specializes in truck/tipper parts, not hand tools
- **Suggest Alternatives**: When customers ask about Teng Tools, suggest the available torque tools from Blue Spot or Martins

### 2. Website Investigation
- **Check Navigation Links**: Verify where the "TENG TOOLS" menu item leads
- **Product Catalog Review**: Confirm if Teng Tools section exists but wasn't scraped
- **Update Navigation**: Remove misleading menu items if no products are available

### 3. Search Optimization
- **Alternative Suggestions**: When "Teng" is searched, suggest similar brands available (Blue Spot, Martins)
- **Category Mapping**: Map tool queries to available categories (torque wrenches, socket sets, etc.)

### 4. Technical Improvements
- **Function Documentation**: Update API documentation with correct `search_content_optimized` parameters
- **Error Handling**: Improve error messages when function parameters are incorrect

## Sample Chat Response Template

When customers ask about Teng Tools products:

```
I understand you're looking for Teng Tools products. Thompson's E Parts specializes in truck, tipper, and trailer parts rather than hand tools. 

However, I can suggest some quality torque tools we do carry:
- Blue Spot Tools 1/2" Torque Wrench
- Martins Impulse Analog Torque Wrenches (50-350 Nm and 200-1000 Nm ranges)

Would you like more information about these torque tools, or are you looking for truck/tipper-related products?
```

## Conclusion

The investigation successfully identified that the "Teng torque" search issue is not a technical bug, but a business context mismatch. The search system is working correctly, and the lack of results accurately reflects the company's product focus on commercial vehicle parts rather than hand tools.

The corrected search function parameters will resolve any technical issues, while the business recommendations will help improve customer experience and reduce confusion about product availability.
