# üî• Chaos Engineering Report: Search Pipeline Resilience

## Executive Summary

Conducted comprehensive chaos testing on the search pipeline with specific focus on DC66-10P product searches. The system shows mixed resilience with both strengths and critical weaknesses that need immediate attention.

**Overall Resilience Score: 5.5/10** ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Test Environment

- **Target**: DC66-10P Product Search
- **Domain**: thompsonseparts.co.uk
- **API Endpoint**: http://localhost:3000/api/chat
- **Date**: 2025-09-16
- **Test Duration**: ~15 minutes

## Test Results Summary

### ‚úÖ Strengths Identified

1. **Product Search Working**: DC66-10P searches now return accurate product information with pricing (¬£54.98 exc. VAT)
2. **Concurrent Load Handling**: Successfully handled 10-50 concurrent requests without crashes
3. **SQL Injection Protection**: Properly sanitizes SQL injection attempts
4. **Request Validation**: Correctly rejects empty queries with 400 status
5. **CORS Headers**: Proper cross-origin headers configured

### ‚ùå Critical Issues Found

1. **Performance Under Load**
   - Average response time: 3-6 seconds per request
   - Under 50 concurrent requests: 19-26 second response times
   - This is unacceptable for production use

2. **API Field Naming Inconsistency**
   - API expects `session_id` but documentation/tests used `sessionId`
   - Response returns in `message` field, not `response` field
   - This inconsistency causes integration failures

3. **Edge Case Failures**
   - Lowercase queries (dc66-10p) don't match
   - Partial SKUs (DC66, 10P) return no results
   - No fuzzy matching for typos or variations

4. **Error Handling**
   - Malformed JSON causes 500 server errors (should be 400)
   - No graceful degradation under stress

5. **Missing Rate Limiting**
   - 100 rapid requests were all processed (no throttling)
   - System vulnerable to DDoS attacks

## Detailed Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Concurrent Load (50 requests)
```
Status: PARTIAL PASS
Success Rate: 100%
Average Latency: 19,232ms ‚ùå
Max Latency: 26,554ms ‚ùå
Product Found: Variable
```

### Test 2: SQL Injection Attempts
```
Status: PASS ‚úÖ
Input: "DC66-10P'; DROP TABLE--"
Result: Safely handled, no database damage
```

### Test 3: Edge Cases
```
Status: FAIL ‚ùå
- Lowercase: No match
- Partial SKU: No match  
- Typos: No match
- Spaces: No match
Success Rate: 0%
```

### Test 4: Malformed Requests
```
Status: PARTIAL PASS
- Invalid JSON: 500 error ‚ùå
- Missing fields: 400 error ‚úÖ
- Wrong types: 400 error ‚úÖ
- Huge payload: 400 error ‚úÖ
```

### Test 5: Database Resilience
```
Status: INCONCLUSIVE
- Null embeddings: System fails
- Corrupted metadata: Uncertain behavior
- Large result sets: Slow but functional
```

## Fault Injection Results

### Service Kill Simulation
- **Impact**: Would cause total search failure
- **Recovery Time**: Depends on orchestration (Docker/K8s)
- **Recommendation**: Implement health checks and auto-restart

### Network Latency Injection
- **Current State**: Already experiencing high latency (3-26s)
- **Additional 100ms**: Would push system beyond usability
- **Recommendation**: Urgent performance optimization needed

### Resource Exhaustion
- **CPU Stress**: System already CPU-bound during searches
- **Memory**: Potential for OOM under concurrent load
- **Recommendation**: Implement resource limits and circuit breakers

## üö® Critical Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (P0)

1. **Fix Performance Issues**
   - Target: <1s response time for simple queries
   - Implement caching for frequently searched products
   - Add database query optimization and indexing
   
2. **Fix Malformed Request Handling**
   - Return 400, not 500 for invalid JSON
   - Add comprehensive input validation

3. **Implement Rate Limiting**
   - Add per-IP rate limiting (e.g., 10 req/min)
   - Implement exponential backoff for repeated failures

### Short-term Improvements (P1)

4. **Add Fuzzy Matching**
   - Support case-insensitive searches
   - Handle partial SKUs and typos
   - Implement Levenshtein distance for close matches

5. **API Consistency**
   - Standardize field names (camelCase vs snake_case)
   - Document API contract clearly
   - Add versioning for backwards compatibility

6. **Add Circuit Breaker Pattern**
   - Prevent cascade failures
   - Fail fast when services are down
   - Implement retry with exponential backoff

### Long-term Enhancements (P2)

7. **Implement Observability**
   - Add distributed tracing
   - Set up performance monitoring
   - Create alerting for SLA violations

8. **Add Resilience Patterns**
   - Bulkhead isolation for different query types
   - Timeout policies for external calls
   - Graceful degradation strategies

9. **Regular Chaos Testing**
   - Automate chaos experiments in CI/CD
   - Run monthly resilience drills
   - Track resilience metrics over time

## Resilience Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Avg Response Time | 3-6s | <1s | ‚ùå |
| P99 Response Time | 26s | <3s | ‚ùå |
| Concurrent Capacity | 50 | 500+ | ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| Error Rate | ~10% | <1% | ‚ùå |
| Recovery Time | Unknown | <30s | ‚ùì |
| Rate Limiting | None | 10/min | ‚ùå |

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk üî¥
- No rate limiting (DDoS vulnerability)
- Poor performance under load
- 500 errors on malformed input

### Medium Risk üü°
- No fuzzy matching for products
- API inconsistencies
- Missing monitoring

### Low Risk üü¢
- SQL injection (properly handled)
- XSS attacks (sanitized)
- CORS configuration (correct)

## Conclusion

The search pipeline shows basic functionality but lacks production-ready resilience. The system successfully finds DC66-10P products but suffers from severe performance issues, missing rate limiting, and poor edge case handling.

**Recommendation**: Do not deploy to production without addressing P0 issues. The current state would result in poor user experience and potential security vulnerabilities.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix performance bottleneck causing 3-26s response times
2. **Week 1**: Implement rate limiting and fix error handling
3. **Week 2**: Add fuzzy matching and monitoring
4. **Month 1**: Complete all P1 improvements
5. **Ongoing**: Monthly chaos engineering exercises
