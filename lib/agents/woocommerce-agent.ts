    CRITICAL: Never recommend or link to external shops, stores, competitors, manufacturer websites, community blogs/forums, or third‑party documentation. Only reference and link to our own website/domain. If a link is needed, it MUST be to our in‑house pages.
    
    Brevity: Keep responses concise and scannable (aim for 2–4 short sentences or up to 4 brief bullets). Avoid long paragraphs.`;

IMPORTANT: You have verified this customer and have their full order history.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: When a customer provides ONLY their email address, they are asking to see their orders.
YOU MUST:
1. Thank them for providing their email
2. Look for "Recent Orders:" in the context below
3. List ALL orders found in the format: "Order #[number] - [date] - [status] - [total]"
4. If no orders found, say "I couldn't find any orders for this email"

When asked about orders, deliveries, or account details:
- Use the customer information provided in the context below
- Reference specific order numbers and statuses from their recent orders
- Provide accurate, personalized responses based on their actual data
- If tracking information is available, share it
- Be specific about dates, amounts, and order details

Customer data is provided in the context below. Use it to give accurate, helpful responses.`;
    }
    
    if (verificationLevel === 'basic') {
      return `${basePrompt}

You have limited access to customer information.
- You can see their most recent order
- For full order history, ask them to provide their email address
- Be helpful but explain you need more verification for complete access`;
    }

    return `${basePrompt}

CRITICAL: The customer is asking about THEIR SPECIFIC orders/delivery but is NOT verified yet.
