# Privacy API

User privacy and data control endpoints for managing personal data and privacy preferences.

## Overview

This API provides user-centric privacy controls including data deletion, privacy settings management, and user data exports. Designed to work in conjunction with GDPR endpoints while providing additional user control features.

## Endpoints

### POST `/api/privacy/delete`

Delete user data with simplified interface for direct user access.

#### Authentication
- **Type**: Session-based identification
- **Privacy**: User ID-based data targeting
- **Safety**: Comprehensive validation and logging

#### Request Format

```json
{
  "userId": "user-session-12345"
}
```

#### Required Fields
- `userId` (string): User session identifier or unique user ID

#### Response Format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "All user data has been deleted successfully"
}
```

#### Process Overview
1. **Validation**: Verify user ID format and existence
2. **Message Deletion**: Remove all user messages from conversations
3. **Conversation Cleanup**: Delete user-specific conversations
4. **Audit Logging**: Record deletion for compliance tracking
5. **Confirmation**: Return success confirmation

## Features

### Simplified Data Deletion
- **Single Identifier**: Uses unified user ID for all operations
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Handles all related data automatically
- **Safety Validation**: Prevents accidental deletions
- **Immediate Processing**: Real-time deletion execution

### Privacy Request Tracking
- **Compliance Logging**: All requests logged to `privacy_requests` table

## Database Operations

### Deletion Process
```sql
-- Step 1: Delete user messages
DELETE FROM messages WHERE session_id = :userId;

-- Step 2: Delete user conversations  
DELETE FROM conversations WHERE session_id = :userId;

-- Step 3: Log privacy request
INSERT INTO privacy_requests (
  user_id, 
  request_type, 
  status, 
  completed_at
) VALUES (
  :userId, 
  'deletion', 
  'completed', 
  NOW()
);
```

### Cascade Relationships
- **Messages → Conversations**: Foreign key relationships maintained
- **User Sessions → Data**: All user-related data removed
- **Privacy Logs**: Deletion events permanently logged
- **Backup Exclusion**: Deleted data excluded from backups

## Security Features

### Data Protection

## Examples

### Simple Data Deletion
```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3000/api/privacy/delete' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "userId": "user-session-12345"
  }'
```

### Batch User Cleanup
```bash
# Delete multiple users (if needed)
for user in user-123 user-456 user-789; do
  curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3000/api/privacy/delete' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d "{\"userId\": \"$user\"}"
done
```

### Verification Before Deletion
```bash
# Check user data exists before deletion
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:3000/api/privacy/status?userId=user-session-12345'

# Then proceed with deletion
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3000/api/privacy/delete' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "userId": "user-session-12345"
  }'
```

## Error Handling

### Common Errors
```json
// Missing user ID
{
  "error": "User ID is required"
}

// Database connection error
{
  "error": "Failed to delete user data"
}

// No data found (still successful)
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "All user data has been deleted successfully"
}
```

### Error Recovery
- **Transaction Rollback**: Automatic rollback on partial failures
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for transient failures
- **Error Logging**: Detailed error information for debugging
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue processing where possible
