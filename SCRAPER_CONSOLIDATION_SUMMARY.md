# Scraper Consolidation Summary
*Last Updated: September 14, 2025*

## ‚úÖ Successfully Consolidated Into `scraper-worker.js`

The following enhancements have been integrated into the main `lib/scraper-worker.js` file:

### 1. **ContentEnricher Integration** (Line 22, 1174-1191)
- Import: `const { ContentEnricher } = require('./content-enricher');`
- Content is enriched with metadata before creating embeddings
- Improves search relevance by including structured data in vectors

### 2. **Enhanced Metadata Extraction** (Lines 617-639)
- `extractProductData()` function extracts e-commerce data from HTML
- Standardized fields added for ContentEnricher:
  - `productSku`
  - `productPrice`
  - `productInStock`
  - `productBrand`
  - `productCategory`

### 3. **Force Rescrape Improvements** (Lines 1182-1190, 1202-1204)
- Detailed logging when `FORCE_RESCRAPE=true`
- Shows extracted metadata (SKU, price, stock, brand, category)
- Explicitly deletes old embeddings before creating new ones

### 4. **E-commerce Metadata Support**
- Extracts from JSON-LD structured data
- Supports multiple price/SKU/stock selectors
- Handles both structured data and HTML element extraction

## üìÅ File Status

### Active Files (Keep These)
- `lib/scraper-worker.js` - **Main production worker with all enhancements**
- `lib/content-enricher.js` - Content enrichment module (used by worker)
- `lib/learning-service.js` - Domain learning capabilities
- `lib/metadata-extractor.js` - Enhanced metadata extraction
- `lib/ecommerce-extractor.js` - E-commerce specific extraction

### Archived Files (Can Be Removed)
- `lib/scraper-worker-enhanced.js.integrated` - Features merged into main worker
- `lib/scraper-with-learning.example.js.integrated` - Example code, features integrated
- `lib/scraper-worker.js.backup-20250911-163216` - Old backup before enhancements

### Standalone/Reference Files
- `lib/scraper-worker-standalone.js` - Standalone version for testing (keep for reference)
- `lib/examples/` - Example usage files (keep for documentation)

## üîß How to Use the Enhanced Scraper

### Force Rescrape with Metadata
```bash
FORCE_RESCRAPE=true node lib/scraper-worker.js
```

### Via API
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/scrape \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://example.com/product",
    "crawl": true,
    "max_pages": 3,
    "turbo": true  # Enables force rescrape
  }'
```

## üéØ Key Benefits of Consolidation

1. **Single Source of Truth** - All scraping logic in one file
2. **Metadata Enrichment** - Content enriched before embedding generation
3. **Better Search Accuracy** - Structured data included in vectors
4. **E-commerce Ready** - Automatic extraction of product data
5. **Domain Learning** - Can adapt to specific domains over time

## üìä Test Results

- ‚úÖ Integration test passed 100%
- ‚úÖ Metadata extraction working on real Thompson's eParts data
- ‚úÖ Product fields (SKU, price, stock) being captured
- ‚úÖ Content enrichment verified in test environment

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Production Testing** - Run force rescrape on production domains
2. **Monitor Logs** - Check for metadata extraction in logs
3. **Verify Search** - Test product searches after rescraping
4. **Clean Up** - Remove archived files after confirming stability
