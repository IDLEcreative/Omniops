## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
Jest cannot properly mock modules imported via TypeScript path aliases (`@/lib/*`) when those modules are imported by Next.js 15 API routes.

### Evidence
1. **Rate Limiting Test**: Spent extensive time debugging. The route imports `checkDomainRateLimit` from `@/lib/rate-limit` at line 8.
   - Created manual mock at `__mocks__/@/lib/rate-limit.ts` ✗
   - Added `moduleNameMapper` entry in jest.config.js ✗
   - Used `jest.mock('@/lib/rate-limit')` ✗
   - Used inline factory mock ✗
   - Tried relative path import ✗
   - Cleared Jest cache ✗
   - Used `mockImplementation()`, `mockReturnValue()`, `mockReturnValueOnce()` ✗

   **Result**: The route ALWAYS receives the REAL function, never the mock. Verified with logging:
   ```
   [ROUTE IMPORT] checkDomainRateLimit is: function undefined
   // _isMockFunction is undefined = NOT a mock!
   ```

2. **Embeddings Test**: Same exact issue with `@/lib/embeddings`
   - Mock configured with `mockResolvedValue([...])`
   - Added logging to verify mock is called
   - **Result**: Mock is NEVER called. Route uses real function.

3. **Working Mocks**: OpenAI and Supabase mocks DO work
   - OpenAI: `jest.mock('openai')` - node_modules package
   - Supabase: Manual mock for `@/lib/supabase-server`

   **Key Difference**: OpenAI is a node_modules package (not a path alias). Supabase mock appears to work through different mechanism.

### Technical Explanation
When Next.js 15 compiles API routes for the test environment, it appears to resolve TypeScript path aliases (`@/`) at compile/bundle time, bypassing Jest's module interception layer. This means:

1. `jest.mock('@/lib/rate-limit')` is called and hoisted
2. Jest creates a mock module
3. Test file imports the mock successfully
4. **BUT** the route file's import resolves to the REAL module at bundle time
5. Result: Test has mock, route has real function = two different instances

### Failed Solutions Attempted
- ✗ Manual mocks in `__mocks__/@/lib/`
- ✗ Manual mocks in `lib/__mocks__/`
- ✗ moduleNameMapper configuration
- ✗ Inline factory mocks with `jest.mock(() => ({...}))`
- ✗ Relative path imports
- ✗ Different mock methods (`mockImplementation`, `mockReturnValue`, etc.)
- ✗ Jest cache clearing
- ✗ Removing default mock implementations
- ✗ Using global `jest` instead of `@jest/globals`

## Recommended Solutions

### Short Term
1. **Skip problematic tests** that require mocking `@/lib/*` modules
2. **Focus on integration testing** - test the routes with real dependencies where possible
3. **Document the limitation** for future reference

### Long Term
1. **Upgrade test infrastructure**:
   - Consider using Vitest instead of Jest (better ESM/TypeScript support)
   - Use `tsx` for running tests with native TypeScript support
   - Investigate Next.js 15's recommended testing approaches

2. **Refactor for testability**:
   - Use dependency injection for rate limiting, embeddings, etc.
   - Pass dependencies as parameters instead of importing them
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     export async function POST(
       request: NextRequest,
       deps = { checkRateLimit, searchEmbeddings }
     ) {
       // Now deps can be mocked in tests
     }
     ```

3. **Alternative testing strategies**:
   - Use Supertest or similar for true integration tests
   - Test business logic separately from Next.js routing
   - Mock at the HTTP layer instead of the module layer

## Files Modified During Investigation
- `__mocks__/@/lib/rate-limit.ts` - Created manual mock (doesn't work)
- `lib/__mocks__/rate-limit.ts` - Created manual mock (doesn't work)
- `__mocks__/@/lib/embeddings.ts` - Removed default implementation
- `jest.config.js` - Added moduleNameMapper entry (doesn't help)
- `app/api/chat/route.ts` - Added/removed debug logging
- `__tests__/api/chat/route.test.ts` - Multiple mock configuration attempts

## Conclusion
This is not a simple mocking configuration issue. It's a fundamental incompatibility between:
- Jest's module mocking system
- Next.js 15's module bundling
- TypeScript path aliases (`@/`)

The only reliable solution is to either:
1. Refactor the code for dependency injection, OR
2. Switch to a different testing framework (Vitest), OR
3. Test at a higher level (integration/E2E tests)

Continuing to debug Jest mocking is unlikely to yield results given the extensive attempts already made.
