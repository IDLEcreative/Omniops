## Implementation Details

### Brand Extraction Strategy
1. **Direct Selectors**: Check common brand selectors like `[itemprop="brand"]`, `.product-brand`, `.manufacturer`
2. **Title Pattern Matching**: Extract brands from product titles using dash patterns (e.g., "Bosch - Product Name")
3. **Known Brand Recognition**: Pattern matching for common brands (Bosch, Makita, DeWalt, Thompson, etc.)
4. **Meta Tag Fallback**: Check meta tags for brand/manufacturer information

### Category Extraction Strategy
1. **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Primary source - extracts hierarchical categories from breadcrumbs
2. **Category Selectors**: Direct category selectors like `.product-category`, `[itemprop="category"]`
3. **Product Taxonomy**: Extracts from WooCommerce product category links
4. **Meta Tag Fallback**: Uses meta category tags as final fallback

## Technical Implementation

### Code Location
- **File**: `lib/scraper-worker.js`
- **Functions**: `extractBrand()` and `extractCategory()` within `extractProductData()`
- **Lines**: 620-757

### Key Features
- Hierarchical category paths (e.g., "Tools > Power Tools > Drills")
- Brand validation (length and format checks)
- Breadcrumb filtering (removes "Home", "Shop" navigation items)
- HTML entity handling in extracted text

## Testing Results

### Thompson's eParts Site
- Successfully extracted "Thompson" brand from product titles
- Full category hierarchy extracted from breadcrumbs
- Average metadata size: 50KB per page (rich product data)
- 100% consolidation rate for metadata fields

### Example Extracted Metadata
```javascript
{
  productSku: '5002-0089',
  productPrice: '£35.00 (was £75.42, 54% off)',
  productInStock: false,
  productBrand: 'Thompson',
  productCategory: 'Tipper & Trailer Sheeting Systems & Spares',
  lastChecked: '2025-09-14T16:06:28.213Z'
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Search Relevance**: Users can now filter by brand and category
2. **Better Product Organization**: Hierarchical categories enable better navigation
3. **Enhanced Embeddings**: Metadata enrichment improves semantic search quality
4. **E-commerce Completeness**: Full product data for cart and checkout features

## Next Steps

### Potential Improvements
1. **Brand Normalization**: Standardize brand names (e.g., "Black & Decker" vs "Black and Decker")
2. **Category Deduplication**: Clean up duplicate segments in breadcrumb paths
3. **Brand Database**: Build a comprehensive brand database for better recognition
4. **Multi-language Support**: Extract brands/categories in different languages
5. **Confidence Scoring**: Add confidence scores to extracted brands

### Monitoring
- Track brand extraction rate over time
- Monitor category hierarchy depth
- Measure search improvement metrics
- Analyze user engagement with filtered results
